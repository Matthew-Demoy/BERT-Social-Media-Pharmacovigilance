@kimberlylsue ‚Äúdata related to management of opioid addiction by GPs in France were published in 2005. However, update is necessary, as the context has changed since then; other drugs were launched on market, such generic buprenorphine, methadone capsule, and Suboxone https://t.co/SzkPw4i0hd
I blatantly just stopped taking my adderall like 5 days ago and I don‚Äôt want to take it again... but I also idk
@DaddyDaddymac @Way2gosassy I am popping xanax like a pez dispenser..
@normal_now trying to act normal on adderall
@DamnitAddie My therapist didn't think I had BP II when I got diagnosed but I could definitely feel the cycles of deep depression to hypomania. Seroquel has helped a lot: it makes me sleep regularly so that helps me with routines.
i havent taken adderall in so long i forgot how shitty it makes me feel bc all i wanna do is throw up rn dshjksdhdjksa
@ishthekidd27 It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre addicted to xanax
@jdigsgrooves Yeah I wish they would be too. You have to clearly ask them to tell you about the effects or they won't. I agreed to take cymbalta for pain stuff and while it works okay, at the time I didn't realize how fucked it would make my head feel. Like sometimes I forget to take it
I might need prescribed adderall fr lol
Every time i went to Applebee‚Äôs for a family outing i threw up. I literally was in the bathroom the whole time, also every time i went there there was a distinct smell of blue cheese and it was NOT Okay!

god damnit i took an adderall and look what i did to my room i need to sit down https://t.co/iSTSd9A3rV
Good thing about my new medicine; lamotrigine is I can woke up early and manage to do usual activities as I  used to be before, although I just sleep for 2hour plus minus. But.. it cannot maintain my happiness for a long long time. Ada tak ubat kegembiraan sepanjang masa?  üòî
So the #seizures started back up Halloween night. Been having to sleep with my mom. I call these seizures "waves of death" because it feels like I die for a second. Great fun. I needed new trauma lol #Paxil #withdrawals #meds #antidepressants #ssri #Psychiatry

@MagsVisaggs Lifelong asthmatic here. I'm so sorry. If she had insurance I'd recommend going to the ER tbh. I believe that albuterol (the active ingredient in rescue inhalers) is by prescription only, although that may have changed. Are you able to go to an urgent care and get an Rx?
@joe_no_privacy ive been experimenting a bit w/ caffeine alongside adderall and my response to everything feels like an inconsistent shitshow
took melatonin but then realized i had 5, 90 question practice exams due tonite. looks like it's actually adderall's time to shine

@dominoblox I hope things are easier for you tomorrow. I was diagnosed with 4 different types of anxiety this past year and taken Xanax and Antivan before to manage accute panic. I take low doses and it just makes me feel sleepy and chill without negative side effects.
@_sloppymakeout I did oxy for 4 years then got off from suboxone. I got hooked on subs then had to taper to limit the wd of subs. Wasn‚Äôt as bad as oxy but was a few days longer w more psychological issues. Start your taper ASAP
@MindfullyBiPola I was finally diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle of pain &amp; depression. I had 1 short depressive episode when I was 18 that was more situational &amp; it was before Prozac. They gave me something that made me feel awful, I stopped it &amp; got better.
Why not do the test and top up the magnesium from the beginning?  Why neglect the depletion of magnesium while patient on Nexium or Esomeprazole until the patient lands up in hospital usually at the end of the road?  NHS is a Criminal Enterprise.
@maydaymindy9 Yes. Xanax is hard to get. Panic attacks at night are not good. Ptsd runs rampant.
@veryslightt I switched to ritalin, which is honestly better for naps. If I drink caffeine with them it keeps me awake. I was never actually really able to nap during the day until I got stimulant meds.
@dvorakoelling Oh yeah. Thanks FUCKING MSNBC for harshing my Xanax mellow.
@MindfullyBiPola Then another postpartum at 21 &amp; Prozac was like a miracle. But after a couple years it stopped working &amp; I went through the gamut of SSRIs. Then I got in a car accident at 29 that permanently injured my lower back &amp; I was always in pain &amp; needing pain meds.
I read on Facebook that someone put their dog on Prozac because it was too hyper. How are people allowed to have pets?
Took adderall for the first time and I‚Äôm honestly amazed. Is this what being a normal human being feels like? Fuck I guess I got all kinds of shit wrong with me. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Honestly Humira is such a hassle. Would much rather deal with pain than a weekly shot of steriods to keep my body from attacking itself üôÉ
@JoanRob11999520 @JeffreyGuterman I heard that before. Adderall is a nasty drug at high enough doses ; it sure would explain a number of things about Trump's behavior. Not to mention he doesnt do anything before 11 am .
I take Ritalin, one of my tweets gets 24 likes. There's definitely a correlation there
@bossassRN No. It‚Äôs been wild after albuterol treatments but it was 145/85 tonight despite using inhaler a few times today

@7Melt The enhanced focus increases focus and not energy levels. It is our attempt at hopefully putting a stop to the abuse of adderall within the community. It relies on vitamins to increase reaction time, cognitive function, and blood circulation to the brain.

remember when touko and I still lived 4000 miles away from each other and I had to smuggle xanax to her so she wouldnt have actual panic attacks literally every day
I'm not sure if there's enough Xanax in the world to help me sleep between now and Tuesday tbh
it really sucked because I had to carefully measure out how much xanax I thought she would need until we saw each other again, and whenever it got bad enough for her to take one we had to count how many were left
@ArianaGrande also..I started taking alprazolam (xanax) for my headaches. It's supposedly to treat anxiety attack and such, but it does seem to work on overactive brains like mine. which means I could keep you up all night if I wanted to (with you consent of course. still, bummer

I know it's silly, because it's been 4 months since I took 1 pill of Cipro and had a reaction, but I still feel kind of shocked it happened and I'm still not well. And then the reality is there is no standard treatment for Cipro reactions even though they are so common

woke up at 5:30am so i can pray the rosary and take my adderall
@MortyAU Yep I‚Äôm on that. But for some reason my depression has gotten a lot worse since halving my dose of my regular anti depressants. Pristiq is known to be an addictive drug. Many people have a lot of trouble coming off it, or reducing the dosage.

Hulu just showed me a commercial for Latuda and I want to fucking scream. Yeah, yeah it is good for bipolar depression. I was doing great on it until the fucking fucked up healthcare system decided I needed to pay $500/month for it. And now I'm just in a constant, numb state
I get Lyrica and A1 had their baby shower but can y‚Äôall save the pics till tomorrow after I watch LHHH
Black Ops 4 has to be by far the single worst Call of Duty game I've ever played. I feel so so bad for the people who rely on this game for content creation. You guys must be all on Adderall if you can tolerate this shit for one match üòÇ
@M0NADELISA imagine xanax taste and orange juice taste together
drugs, alcohol ///my housemate is smashed and also looped out on xanax and im a little worried but it's also just fucking SOMETHING to listen to
I wish I had never been prescribed Latuda. I hate that my depression was amplified by the loss of that medication. At least before it felt manageable.
is there a way to obtain the effects of stimulants without actually taking any and doesnt takr a lot of timei really dont want to actually try Adderall and i have no time to fix my well-being : ) tfw fat n ugly n dumb n brown n stressed n cryin
@Greg_MarineLab @james00000001 @JeanneHitchcoc2 Nexium over the counter isn‚Äôt as effective as the prescription one. I researched to see if I should use it and not the prescription. The generic one isn‚Äôt as effective either. Personal experience told me that.
it‚Äôs xanax o clock aka i‚Äôm gonna knock out hard and wake up to my 5:33 gym alarm disoriented asf
For me, cannabis has replaced 3 medications including Xanax, Ambien, and a pain medication. And I don‚Äôt feel loopy the next morning. So... yeah, marijuana is evil. Blah, blah, blah.
I‚Äôm going to sleep.As always, NORTH OVER EVERYTHING.And thanks Prozac for getting me through another day
Why this look like lyrica mama tho?
I hate Xanax but I‚Äôm off 6 of em and I need a pretty girl to give me a hug
@NotInUnderland We‚Äôre you on cymbalta? That‚Äôs what I use for mine. If you have any questions let me know
@Arkady2009 Pristiq isn‚Äôt addictive, though there is some heavy withdrawal symptoms - applies to nearly all anti-depressants ü§ÆTalk to your GP but I‚Äôd be much more worried about worsening depression than being sick for a few days when you eventually get off them üò¨
@ddale8 My Adderall co-pay tripled in the first half of the year. I literally need that to work.
My anxiety won‚Äôt leave me tf alone. I just want Xanax smoothie at this point https://t.co/DyWB4Dppkw
@Iamchronicpain @ThomasJWilson7 @StarvinLarry @ChronicHLC @Shasta77777 @heatherzamm @process_x @SpicyPurritos @AmaraAdvocate Suboxone binds so tightly to the area of the brain that emergency meds like morphine will not work. If a doctor tries to up the dosage of regular opiates, they won‚Äôt take effect until 3-5 days later and PRESTO! You have an overdose.
@ToccoDK üíö we will feed you + make you cookies tomorrow, and Rick will do your work for you (obviously).  Better than Xanax?
Which is cute because that means he thinks people are going to his "wall" to see his posts.But anyway, he's going on an Adderall fueled tear about it.#FeatureOrFlaw
@azurehrebuke Both Lyrica &amp; Gabapentin worked for a bit, but then after dose changes, I gained wait, exhaustion,  blurry eyes. My original dr didn't care about vision or was not aware of that side effect. Dropped Lyrica,  a month later I could see fine. I missed 3 yrs of driving I have MS.
@beside Man that sucks cause I feel like they don‚Äôt have any recreational value if ur prescribed them. Last year I hated taking adderall and would just go off meds most days.
@leahmcelrath @bethecricket My body reacts strangely to Xanax. It straight knocks me out for hours so I can‚Äôt really take it. But I saved it just in case I ever need to be sedated into oblivion. Got it on deck for Tuesday but praying it will not be necessary.

@celestefinesse Due to the data I‚Äôve gathered if you have a Xanax prescription and take around half of a pill you should be out for around 13 hours or so. Should be out like a light tbh.

Day 4 back on prozac: I sat in the bathtub for two hours and read the last half of a novel I decided to reread in May of this year. I‚Äôd only gotten halfway through before my motivation tanked then.
Obviously prozac doesn‚Äôt kick in immediately and I‚Äôll really be looking for results about a month from now but hey at least I have energy from the side effectsProblem is this energy had me up until like 5am the past few nights
I hear voices in my head, they‚Äôre telling me to call it quits. I find some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep üîäüó£

@DebbieF83605680 @Chevron The problem with ADD is your basically treated for symptoms, and the treatment (like Ritalin) had unknown long term effects. It directly interferes with the amygdala.Better results can be shown from giving kids more recess.
Have an ear ache?You probably have Bibliomania.This causes failure.Try Xanax
@AntiGrinch Ugggh. I take 900mg of gabapentin daily (was 3600 at one point which was just absurd) plus lyrica and melatonin and tramadol and it shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to sleep. Solidarity from my blanket pile to yours.

Lyrica suppressed my sons breathing and he died in his sleep...Lyrica JUST Lyrica If it can kill by itself then do not co prescribe with opiates
fuck your parents if they make you take ADHD medication like adderall or ritalin etc. they are ignorant and they are destroying your brain's ability to function normally
@TanistheGOAT I know Canada's universal health care bill doesn't cover prescriptions, but you should look into Effexor; it's a terrific antidepressant with almost no side effects.I started taking it bc of severe post-surgery depression and couldn't believe the difference.
bref can someone send me a xanax or something so i can sleep for a couple of hours
Anytime I see one of those ‚Äúcharming‚Äù comedies about mildly neurotic yet loving families everyone's meant to relate to I feel a lifetime of repressed childhood anger burning in my belly &amp; a black depression descend that takes at least a Xanax &amp; some masochistic sex to alleviate.
Fuckkme. I took too much albuterol and I can‚Äôt stop shaking yet I‚Äôm still wheezing. I‚Äôll just die now thanks.

@bridget_cecelia @deefizzy I'm not trying to be mean.... but like I have "anxiety" so I gotta eat xanax all day to just talk to people is not human. It's from social media and these fuckin smart phones. I've had people crying in my face over twitter and it's not real life or healthy

So, statins R the #1 prescribed medication in America. But there R controversies. One of which is: Statins, i.e. Lipitor, lowers chlorestorol which if high can lead 2 attacks. But if eating unhealthy is what led you 2 statins, might they also aid in dying some other way? ü§îüòé https://t.co/Ng27pR7xqj

Xanax "My crippling Depression"
Having a full on mental breakdown, I feel like I joke about having one quite often but like I‚Äôm actually having one. Idk what to do with my life at all. Literally what am I doing with my life. Full on panic attack coming in like 5 minutes I feel it. Klonopin is a lie. Need Xanax.
I‚Äôd legitimately cut off my arm for a Xanax. Not only would it help my anxiety which I normally get at night but it would help me sleep. It would eliminate my anxiety about dying in my sleep and just let me sleep.
This isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm having a breakdown over but I feel like since I was addicted to Xanax and everyone judged tf out of me (except jack) that I have to justify why I want xanax. I learned my lesson, id never abuse it again. But when I used it properly it helped. I need that

i mean the chemistry checks out‚Äîthe combination is very synergistic (one pill releases the dopamine, the other blocks it's reuptake slightly), but i'm just surprised that i went from feeling very little from my adderall to Alert And Focused
@Taciturnium Well Tactiturnium, perhaps the author could have expressed himself more sensitively but the subject is very relevant. Antidepressants were sold to the 'Prozac Generation' not only as safe &amp; effective but as a lifestyle choice, the 'mood brightener', quite a glib assertion.

@skylxrksays @TomasKylexxx @joshh_dp Discontinuance syndrome is revolting. Depending on the type of drug, but SNRIs are notoriously worse. Pristiq is so bad I refuse to prescribe it. And you can‚Äôt really wean. Efexor you kind of can but I‚Äôve had patients get compounded pills to taper.

@schlutes @TomasKylexxx @joshh_dp This was Cymbalta, from what I've read online, it's among the worst to stop. When I complained about the feelings to my GP she had no idea what could be causing them and I had to come back with Dr. Google results before she acknowledged that it might have been the meds.
@susi_debra @rolandscahill Actually it's probably going to be more like 56 hours? Because results won't be in until morning for a lot of races. My xanax is working double duty.
Praise Jesus for Xanax or I would of gotten no sleep last night
@workingontact My doctor has me trying Cymbalta to help block nerve pain.  I wear a Fitbit and the sleep tracker shows me not waking up nearly as often and more deep sleep.
@skylxrksays @TomasKylexxx @joshh_dp Cbalta does have a bad rep but Pristiq actually has a class action running in the US. The problem is the ‚Äòstarting dose is maintenance dose‚Äô crap. It gives you no option to half or quarter (as theyre caps). So a lot of people get the caps compounded to 15mg and 7.5mg to wean.
@MattKlinske Totally get you. I've had so many psych meds over the years as well, currently have a tightrope act going with Ritalin/Concerta. Yet another one I'm having an unusual response to, but this time in the positive sense. Work better than expected! ü§úü§õ we all got plenty in common!

In 2001 (5th grade) my parents put me on some form of generic Xanax (probably because of 9/11.) All it did was make me woke as fuck. My teacher didn't know how to handle it.
I'm not going to lie, my anxiety level has reached an all time high. I wonder if the prescriptions for Xanax are going to sky rocket over the next couple of days.
@LibertarianNole The beginning of my flight back was terrible. A kid was kicking my seat! Being hungover and sleep deprived brings out the mean in me. Bit my tongue and popped a couple Xanax, all was good.

@dmannion5_ What about long term use of adderall or painkillers. Both taken as prescribed can have more serious side effects than long term use of pot. Not saying weed has no side effects long term but theres definately other Legal and more dependable drugs out there that ppl need to worry

@tonyschwartz @tonyschwartz see a doctor about your problem. Or consult with the DNC on how many people will vote twice. How many dead people will vote dem. How many voting machines can be hacked. If you can‚Äôt sleep try Xanax.
@BAHHNGA325 I used to have Xanax but haven‚Äôt been able to refill it in awhile. Sometimes I use weed, sometimes I use Benadryl or another sedative, it just depends. Last night I had back spasms so I took a muscle relaxer and it ended up knocking me back out lol

@tonyschwartz Take some Xanax, you'll sleep better after the coming Red tidal wave!

@DogginTrump I'm so tense and anxious I may just spontaneously combust. It's definitely Xanax time.
@Khakibandi @BeeNotjune Many domestic helpers are so abused throughout their lives that they become venomous and abusive. I know a maid who gave Xanax to her Baji so she would sleep and the maid can sneak out to see her boyfriend. All maids are not alike.
Honestly? the REAL reason why I stopped taking vyvanse is bc my doctor wanted to start drug testing me and a bitch just couldn‚Äôt give up marijuana.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
@AnjunaLemon right... spark by advocare is the closest I‚Äôve found to it. I basically replaced my vyvanse with spark.

@NuclearAnthro @lavawitch @phil_b_reed I wonder if any anxiety sufferer names their cats after neuroses medications. This white fluffy one? She's Xanax. This slender pied orange tabby? He's Prozac. This cute elderly tuxedo? He's Ambien.
WAIT, I FORGOT, JAPANESE FINALS THAT SEMESTER WAS THE WORST BECAUSE AMPHETAMINES WERE INVOLVED.Don't take Adderall if you've got bipolar, kids.
@callmehuff @AnjunaLemon It‚Äôs essentially a vitamin supplement with 120mg of caffeine which is about or equal to a cup of coffee. You mix one scoop with 8-10oz of water and drink it in the morning and in the afternooon. Gives you all of the energy vyvanse does but it‚Äôs natural and has less side effects.
@svershbow for some reason I thought the xanax was birth control and combined with the vodka, sounded like a fun night.
Don't we all, this could go very well or very bad...
WAIT, SCRATCH THAT FIRST PART, STUDYING FOR FINALS THAT SEMESTER WAS WAY WORSE BECAUSE AMPHETAMINES WERE INVOLVED.Don't take Adderall if you've got bipolar, kids.

I really wish someone didn‚Äôt steal my adderall I‚Äôm going to be so mother fucking salty about it until I can get a refill next month. I wish I could choke which ever friend of mine stole it. Because sadly it was someone I know.

i took adderall today for the first time in like 2 weeks i feel like ima explode
xanax leaves the absolute worst taste in ur mouth it‚Äôs not worth it anymore i‚Äôm DONE
Which finally brings me to fentanyl an opiate so strong TOUCHING IT can be deadly. Only meant to be prescribed to those who have high risk of death to deal with the most extreme pain. This is being laced into so many things from heroine to Cocaine to Xanax.
(Hmmmm)(maybe I‚Äôm prescribed adderall bc I have an attention disorder &amp; maybe I should, like, use it?) (hmmmmm)((idk)(probably just gonna keep using it to feel joy when I‚Äôve been bummed a lil too long))

@HoarseWisperer I've taken to compiling an excel spreadsheet of all races... including state legislatures. State leg will determine state election reform. We can't depend on feds to do it. But yeah, got my xanax ready for tomorrow fer sure.
Straight off the head but they gon' think that I wrote this couldn't afford no bed, on the floor with all the roaches shawty got good head, pussy wet just like the ocean adderall and the percys the only thing that keep me focused
This. 1,000,000 times this. Other organizations should stop worrying about fighting things like ICD-10 &amp; MOC and care more about helping us help our patients. Having a kid not able to get albuterol covered for their asthma burns me out. Not sending the Rx electronically . #AAP18
Have trouble focusing?Yes?You suffer from Depression.This causes denial.Try Xanax
So now I have to ride out a few days of olanzapine withdrawal. Everything's looking dismal this evening. Keep reminding myself it will wear off and things will look different again soon.
i drabk a whole monster and took an adderall this morning an f i feel like  papa freezeria as a person in 2018
@HoarseWisperer Dude, I've been surviving the past week on a combination of Xanax &amp; the "energy" version of that popular water flavoring. Seriously that stuff is more powerful than coffee, tea, amphetamines...I'm up until like 4am, but I'm totally chill about it.
@parscale @NBCNews @CNN @facebook Brad, shhhhh - calm down before you hurt yourself. Take a Xanax. Take a fistful.  You're gonna need em.
@katiekrobot omg we didn‚Äôt go out in 2016 and I‚Äôm so glad, my entire body composition was just xanax and cabernet by the end of the night

@sim_manager I know this all too well. I'll probably stay away from Phenibut all together. But I wonder if baclofen can have some effect on the GABA supplement not passing the BBB. Either way it helps my stomach tremendously to have GABA
@iamlewisdean I have anxiety, bipolar and manic depressive (so they said years ago) I was put on zyprexa a mood stabilser and i did not like it as it kept me on a low and i wrote a lot of poetry but it made me too deep if that makes sense.  I was in another realm.  continued...

@HoarseWisperer I know you‚Äôre probably kidding. But mixing xanax and alcohol can cause death. So stick to one or the other.

@lucifersrealmom @beratings When I was on Effexor I had this happen to!! Sudden movements especially emphasized them or getting up too fast. The only way I was able to have them stop completely is either just continue taking it or have my body adjust to not take it anymore (which is where I‚Äôm at now)
@thelittleleftie @irisstylosa Ah, Jumpy Leg Syndrome. One of my relatives does, on Fluoxetine. I get that on Quetiapine. Irritating!

Xanax was the new herion, fentanyl‚Äôs the new Xanax, easier to cook then meth, easier to find then a lot of downers. People get addicted not even knowing what they‚Äôre getting into.

fentanyl is one of, if not the most extremely dangerous opioid that exists, and it has recently been used to cut with other drugs like cocaine, xanax, etc... for perspective, 30mg of heroin will kill you but only 3mg of fentanyl will kill you. BE FUCKING SAFE, GUYS. PLEASE.

@DamnitAddie I'm pretty sure Adderall's anti-depressant effect is due to the dopamine boost.  I know Wellbutrin works the same way.  (I'm on Wellbutrin for depression + Paxil for anxiety.).     I can *fall asleep* after taking adderall.  :-)

@whimsical_libra I started on Paxil, was switched to Lexapro due to side effects and eventually found Effexor XR was the perfect fit.

Why he wants to be with Lyrica after all that? Wasnt A1 was cheating too? #LHHH
All Lyrica had to do was stay faithful and all Brooke has to ever do is mind her own damn business. She say's she's on the side of the truth, but it's more like the side of stirring the pot.#LHHH
i really wish A1 momma would put more energy into her image and less energy into A1 &amp; Lyrica relationship. #LHHH
A1 mom is obbsessed. Like lady let it go already. That man not leaving Lyrica #LHHH #LHHHollywood
Lyrica hair looks horrible
I feel like A1 cheated on Lyrica &amp; that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs allowing her to do what she‚Äôs doing! #LHHH
@ChasingOzPhotog @GOP Break out the generator so you're prepared. But also have some Xanax on hand. Just in case.
Lyrica really was cheatingggg
a1 prolly wanna have a 3sum with the man MINUS Lyrica - cause he's okay with her cheating it seems like #LHHH #Lhhhollywood
but is A1 brother's wife receipts about Lyrica valid though? #LHHH
I‚Äôm so glad this is the finale because I‚Äôm so sick of this plot with Lyrica cheating. #LHHH
A1 just doesn‚Äôt seem like Lyrica type. #LHHH
I‚Äôm sick of this A1 &amp; Lyrica situation... everybody stupid. #LHHH
I still believe A1 and lyrica nonsense is all fake lol #LHHH
@TeviaThaMAC Facts! The fact lyrica was so pissed at Kmichelle n hating her but Brooke was so the one keeping it going for the rest of the season. That‚Äôs who she needs to be really mad with y‚Äôall
Pam is too much. She‚Äôs always doing too much. A1 is a grown ass man. He can handle his own business. At this point, she needs to just let that man make his own decisions. Lyrica is his wife. If he wants to be w| her, that‚Äôs HIS decision. Damn. #LHHH
Lyrica and her mama and A1 mama wigs be 50 shades of FUCKED UP #LHHH
A1 is right tho. Your wife is supposed to come first. Buttttttt, Lyrica is mad shady this season.  #LHHH https://t.co/JI8MKLKO3J
it‚Äôs obvious Lyrica has done this before .... you just condoning that shit !!! #LHHH
A1 and Lyrica's moms are all kinda fucked up #LHHH
It‚Äôs clear that yes Lyrica was unfaithful to A1 &amp; A1 is okay with that and just wants to move on with his marriage &amp; his ‚Äúsuppose‚Äù child  #LHHH
#Lhhh  did A1 just say that Lyrica comes first I‚Äôm not say This dude is an Idiot Like you put your family first not no Your wife. At the end of the day family is all you got if the fake marriage even last  on the show since this is Lyrica and A1 Last Season On @loveandhiphop
#LHHH who gave Aunty Pam the blonde wig. It don't even want a part. Plus I understand her concern about Lyrica but Pam always negative. They trying to rebuild their relationship, respect that. https://t.co/Y3vmVjhCDa
Lyrica has terrible fashion sense
Lyrica admitted to cheating in her new album soo they the storyline with her and Brooke it‚Äôs annoying #LHHH
I wish A1‚Äôs mom focused more on these wigs she be wearing , than she do her son &amp; Lyrica‚Äôs business. Lady Please! Put more attention into getting a decent looking wig... or two! #LHHH https://t.co/6xSErF0c2V
#LHHH A1 and Lyrica both admitted to stepping out. The made up and moved on. We need to move on... https://t.co/ahpN1w2JxZ
Y‚Äôall acting like K Michelle ain‚Äôt start the rumor with lyrica cheating on A1 with safaree . Now get off Brooke #LHHH

@Kelz_SoFeisty Remember when Lyrica G lost it cuz they got married without her bamma ass ...she needs to get a life
Poor A1 Lyrica got his whole mind fucked up #LHHHollywood
If i  ever needed an adderall it would be today
I don't think Brooke should apologize to Lyrica her own mama thought she was fucking Safaree #LHHH
Honestly, when you take someone‚Äôs hand in marriage, your spouse comes before everyone. It‚Äôs actually in the Bible which is why the parents gives the wife away. So yes your wife comes before family.

So Safaree never had sex with Lyrica? Then why the hell was he being so fucking coy about it?! Naw, something ain‚Äôt right! He has to be lying! I wasted a whole season for this?! #LHHH
Safaree we already know you didnt sleep with Lyrica #LHHH
All Safaree had to say was he didn‚Äôt have sex with Lyrica from the beginning .. nigga sat there just making funny ass faces every time someone asked
Lyrica was like come beat cheeks real quick while a1 at the studio #LHHH
We waited all season just to hear Safaree say he didn‚Äôt sleep with Lyrica. Like y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt establish this in the 5th episode? #lhhh https://t.co/0vy4iYKI5O
Safaree finally confirmed what we've known all along. Lyrica didn't cheat on A1 with Safaree. Perhaps now, we can finally put this issue to bed. #LHHH

#LHHH Safaree got coached by Lyrica he's not trying to admit anything deny deny deny https://t.co/8mxLXCEbML

This Safaree and Lyrica situation is starting to give me a headache ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ. I don‚Äôt know who or what to believe anymore. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs lying and who‚Äôs telling the truth. #LHHH
Safaree never really said he fucked Lyrica. He didn‚Äôt clear it up either. He said some things but he never really flat out said ‚ÄúI fucked Lyrica.‚Äù Ray J ran w| that rumor. And it caused all that drama. #LHHH

#LHHH these mofo's ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è why Lyrica and A1 momma hair never done
I never believed they smashed, but Lyrica always sharing her problems and personal business with everyone dragging everyone else into her marriage and i do believe that there may have been some flirty texts, but nothing serious. #LHHH
a1 &amp; lyrica really out here making themselves look goofy af disrespecting their marriage and taking DNA test just so Mona can cut them a check lmfaoooo dumb ass bitches
This A1 and Lyrica storyline is so tired. If A1 has made peace with her cheating then why are we still talking about it? #LHHH
Safaree knows he‚Äôs wrong. He was implying that he was doing something with Lyrica. Ray J didn‚Äôt get that from out of nowhere. #LHHH
Spoiler alert: I seen the Wendy Williams episode of A1 &amp; lyrica. She got the DNA test the baby is A1‚Äôs &amp; he was cheating too ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #LHHH
Both Safaree and Lyrica lying like shit #LHHH
Safaree never really said he had sex with lyrica #LHHH
Lyrica‚Äôs hair keeps annoying me. It looks better black. She and A1 looks musty together ü§¢
I feel like Safari made a pass or sent Lyrica that pic or video #LHHH

#LHHH A1: did u sleep wit LyricaSafaree: (turned into this nigga) https://t.co/fxgOzxn7oI
She definitely smashed bc anyone would get tired of looking at A1's bleach blonde fucking locs during missionary every damn night.
Safaree might have sent a pic but he didnt sleep with Lyrica #LHHH
Ima 1000 percent sure lyrica fucked safaree #LHHHollywood
If y'all really think that safaree slept with lyrica y'all just as crazy as lyrica for letting Mona running this storyline  #LHHH https://t.co/WEkQZEwfuA
I think it was like 12 or so episodes ago that I said Safaree was gonna come back and say that nothing happened with Lyrica... #LHHH https://t.co/fjAgEYoIgu
#LHHH a1 mama looks a mess as well as big lyrica &amp; yall needs to stay out their damn business üôÑ a1 brother wife with all these textes ok they confided in you so wtf are you telling their secrets for ü§®
I hate the way Safaree is handling this. He should be fully honest and stop giving vague answers. Part of me feels like he's being vague to protect someone's feelings (either A1 or Lyrica). Like something happened but he doesn't want to say "She said it was cool." #LHHH
the nerve of mona trying to sell us this fake lyrica/safaree scandal shit all season though. let me guess, A1 and Safaree will have some ‚Äúgrand confrontation‚Äù over this bullshit at the reunion, then hug it out? keep it. #LHHH

Her previous ex boyfriends from her past. ü§î cause Lyrica seems real guilty  about the betrayal she did https://t.co/ZiAX8MceGt
A1 know he‚Äôs done dirt before too which is probably why he ain‚Äôt trippin on Lyrica but see they business is in the streets so it just looks bad  #LHHH
Lyrica you looked guilty AF all season, of course he‚Äôs gonna ask for a dna test #LHHH
I could see Lyrica's kitchen while she was in the kitchen. #LHHH
lyrica works my last damn nerves. she so damn annoyingüòí #LHHH
this whole lyrica cheating scandal has lasted for years. i‚Äôm over it. ugh! #lhhh
Lyrica has been a miss this entire season. Hair makeup wardrobe storyline ALL A MISS!!! #LHHH
I don‚Äôt think Lyrica cheated... I think she‚Äôs just a big ass flirt
Lyrica thought putting a hat over her horrible wig was better than putting on a new wig? #LHHH
Damn so we thought Lyrica was lying all season ü§£ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #LHHH
Lyrica, you looked guilty AF all season, so OF COURSE he‚Äôs gonna ask for a DNA test. I would too! #LHHH #LHHHollywood

Safaree is lying straight through that fake hairline of his! Ray J is a messy queen , but YOU did insinuate that you &amp; Lyrica did something! If you lied on your üçÜ , you‚Äôre lame! If you did something with your friend‚Äôs girl , your lame! So either way... you‚Äôre lame! #LHHH

Lyrica can‚Äôt fake cry for shit.
Lyrica .... now folks not just gone randomly start saying they slept with you. I need the truth. #LHHH
I said this before but A1 and Lyrica trash for letting Mona play with their marriage and unborn child like this. The fact that your wife had to take a paternity test... hurt like that doesn‚Äôt go away and it erodes a marriage #LHHH https://t.co/WdvsQcvKgu

Every time A1 confront lyrica about what people saying she start that dumb ass crying and getting mad lol you not slick hoe #lhhh

@TheAuthorGuy Xanax while rubbing my temples thinking, "calm blue oceans"
A1 really gone tell Lyrica she doesn‚Äôt understand the feeling of DNA test being brought up like the baby not in her stomach. #LHHH
Lyrica took the convo in a whole different direction #LHHH https://t.co/rPzagKVukA
#LHHH So did she just admit to sleeping around cause Lyrica said "but your family said you wasn't coming back, you took your clothes &amp; dog, you let me by myself"
* lyrica get this dna test......so this all can be settled. #LHHH
Damn. This was so intense. N I‚Äôm mad Lyrica started crying tho  #LHHH
Watching A1 and lyrica is so sad
I low key feel bad for A1 and I do think Lyrica is a hoe on the low or the high lol #LHHH
I‚Äôm so sick of Lyrica. Like girl #LHHH
Lyrica is always throwing on fake tears and start playing victim when she gets caught in a lie!!! #LHHH
So did Lyrica sleep with Safaree or nah #LHHH
A1, don't listen to what people say. They don't know about you and Lyrica. They're just jealous. #LHHH
Lyrica you cheated &amp; ended up pregnant. Girl bye #LHHH
Lyrica ain‚Äôt shit. Them fake ass tears.

Lyrica was fake crying like a mf #LHHH
If I were Lyrica I wouldn‚Äôt get a dna test unless A1 agreed to sleep with his hair wrapped. Cuz tf #LHHH https://t.co/nM7k9aBHDI
Lyrica, if you KNOW you ain‚Äôt got shit to hide, just take the DNA test! #LHHH #LHHHollywood
A-1 said he wants a blood test for the baby dang poor lyrica
Safaree says they texted about Lyrica saying A1 not giving her enough attention but when Lyrica showed A1 her message thread it was empty #LHHH https://t.co/ZElv3j1bV6
I thought this was a storyline but Lyrica and A1 might actually have real life problems #LHHH https://t.co/FaoKb1qdb8
Lyrica telling A1 he left her by herself and she didn‚Äôt think he was coming back is basically her telling him she did talk to or fw other people for a minute lol. #LHHH #lhhhollywood

Lyrica annoys me #LHHH https://t.co/740ruIaZ38
I wouldn't do no DNA test if I know for a fact I wasn't creeping sooooo Lyrica definitely did sumthing #LHHH
I'm sorry but A1 is not wrong for wanting a DNA test.. like he said he doesn't feel 100% about the baby being his sooo you gotta do what you gotta do Lyrica ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #LHHH
If Lyrica don't take them dam lashes off ü§£üò§ #LHHH
This is so messed up. It‚Äôs obvious these ppl was lying on lyrica and it caused so much doubt that now A1 now wants a dna test
Lyrica and A1 scene feel like some ‚ÄúYoung and The Restless‚Äù shit #LHHH
Lyrica chested point blank period
Moe when A1 said ‚ÄúDNA‚Äù test Lyrica eyes went üëÄ real fast ü§£
Lyrica you guilty as hell lol, if you knew it was A1‚Äôs you wouldn‚Äôt be tripping #LHHH
I gotta meet Lyrica man #LHHH LMAO girl really retard.
Lyrica tryna be sweet so he‚Äôll change his mind #LHHH
I do think Lyrica is lying though.  #LHHH
What‚Äôs worse Lyrica &amp; A1 bullshit or Tierra Mari &amp; Akbar üëÄü§£#LHHH
@SnowXwonS @Lattesdotter11 @runninginterror How's your blood pressure? Effexor can cause/aggravate hypertension, and hypertension can cause overheating and excessive sweating...
A1 is real af for saying yes tbh. Cus Lyrica has been moving funny and f she been complaining about not getting dick but she pregnant.
Did Lyrica sleep with Safaree? #LHHH
Idk whose d$&amp;k you sat on Lyrica but you sat on somebody‚Äôs d$&amp;k other than A1. That speech ‚Äúyou took your things and then left; I was all alone (followed by 2sec tears). Ok....so you did what during that time? üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #LHHH
If I was concerned after something like what Lyrica and A1 is going through, I‚Äôd want a dna test as well. I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm playing step daddy to a child that this entire time I thought was mine. Especially when lies and confusion is all around. Call it whatever. #LHHH
I know Lyrica feelings are toooooo hurt right now #LHHH https://t.co/eYzHRQGDjh
Every time A1 confront lyrica about what people saying she start that dumb ass crying and getting mad lol you not slick hoe #LHHH
@drcadesky @DrRitaMc @RogerWong10 @1mcg8 Agree! Without good prescribing strategy, benzos can be very harmful for elderly. Often low dose trazodone is better off to start with, even for anxious behaviours in Dementia!
i‚Äôm honestly not mad at A1‚Äôs decision on wanting lyrica to get a DNA test. #LHHH
All Lyrica worried about is this vow renewal...girl hush! üôÑ Crybaby self! #LHHH https://t.co/W9ZZN0H0cB
Lyrica is making herself look guilty talking about being "stressed out". #lhhh https://t.co/dSYJqVYDAG
I never believed they smashed, but Lyrica always sharing her problems and personal business with everyone dragging everyone else into her marriage she was bound to send some flirty texts eventually. #LHHH
I don‚Äôt blame A1 for wanting to get a dna test! ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Lyrica might be hurt , but oh well! More than one person has told this man , wtf you allegedly did with other men while being with A1! Honestly... I don‚Äôt feel sorry for her! #LHHH

So now Safaree is saying that he said YES to TEXTING Lyrica, but not FUCKING her? So then why didn‚Äôt he just say that to Ray J straight up?! The way he went about the whole situation just angers me. #LHHH
I feel bad for Lyrica, and I honestly feel like she's owed an apology. But you know mfs don't ever want to admit that their wrong. #LHHH

Lyrica pissing me off with all this damn crying.  #LHHH
I feel so bad for lyrica #lhhh
every minute every day. I've just learned some new things through this such as Flexeril works better for my muscle pain and Fibromyalgia which is ignored a lot. That Lyrica works better for me than Gabapentin from taking expired Lyrica that I had. I have seen a lot in my support
groups of brain fog with Gabapentin I already know I have trouble with it when it is raised high. I took some Lyrica I only had about 6 took one a day I can not tell you how much more clear-headed I feel as well as just 1 a day has handled my nerve pain leg pain down  to taking
Wellll lyrica slept with the enemy .smh #LHHH
I feel so bad for A1. Like he really just be minding his business. Lyrica is the one that brought him all that drama #LHHH
A1 really needs to get his mind right about Lyrica. I know she is pregnant&amp; everything, but at the same time she stepped out on their marriage. That shit is low. #LHHH
I honestly don't think Lyrica slept with either one of them messy ass niggas!
#lyrica needs to talk to production cause they making her look all kinds of hoe ish.. And I know that check aint that Damn good!? #LHHH
They all owe Lyrica an apology tbh  #LHHH

Why I have a feeling A1 fina call off the vow renewal infront of everyone ? If he do thats fckd up, ian team lyrica but its fuckd up #LHHH

Mona wants me to believe Roccstar had sex with Lyrica. I don‚Äôt know who she‚Äôs fooling, but it ain‚Äôt me. #LHHH https://t.co/ENerXZ1GaO
I feel like Safaree and Lyrica still lying, even if they didn‚Äôt have sex.. something still happened between them idc idc idc #LHHH
If Safari really ain‚Äôt sleep with Lyrica why he always beat around the bush about it instead of just saying ‚Äúno I didn‚Äôt have sex with her‚Äùü§î It don‚Äôt add upü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #LHHH
How about Roccstar corny ass do a lie detector test.. Just have him, Safaree, and Lyrica do one on the reunion or before and read the results @loveandhiphop @MonaScottYoung @VH1 #lhhh
Personally, Ray J never let Safaree get all of his words out about the Lyrica situation.  #LHHH
I don't pop Xanax 'coz pills are for pussiesNever scared of being humanI ain't afraid of feeling feelings Got that anger, for that razorCareful, do not run into me.

@rayj made himself look foolish doing the absolute most messiness. Can't blame #Safaree for that. However Safaree could've spoken up a long time ago! And Lil Energizer Bunny Roccstar is lying. I do not believe he slept with #Lyrica. I think he's a jerk &amp; tells a lot of lies #LHHH
Shannon and Vicki's screeching is driving me to Xanax. #rhoc Now twerk it girl.
Roccstar so damn lame tho I can‚Äôt see Lyrica lettin him hit ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #LHHH
Safaree managed a way to have story line about sleeping with Lyrica without be present for every episode. So he can go film for love and hip New York at the same time. https://t.co/H0kiGcIrSY

@chucktodd how much adderall did you take tonight
@TomHall Probably because they have him stoned on Xanax on all. That‚Äôs a common practice with places like Sea World and zoos. I wish I were kidding. üò™
Steve Kornacki's adderall better be paid for directly out of MSNBC's pockets and not come off his health plan
I feel the sick and sad echoes of 2016. Hope I‚Äôm wrong but my nerves can‚Äôt take it. Xanax and bedtime.
@williamlegate I have to take a Xanax and go to bed.
@michaelschweitz There is not enough xanax in the world right now!
The rum has not slowed down the vyvanse/ephedrine cocktail I ate around 12pm today. My brain is on fire.
@andie Same. Causing me to take a xanax.
@damnfrankz @_FatNick If you want Xanax or other pills you just gotta ask. Adderall? Ask. The real problem is they give it to anyone that easily. Then you need more than prescribed once you‚Äôre addicted. Then you go to the streets. Then you accident get fentanyl in the streets and die. It‚Äôs fucked up
adhd is a fucking bitch tbh i just want a normal brain :( adderall only lasts so long.....
@ddale8 Stress ate a toblerone and took a Xanax a half hour ago.
hehe the doctor is so funny with his advices &amp; thank god he gave something lighter than xanax üôè
Xanax is literally only good for its prescribed purpose to lower heart rate and calm down anxiety attacksIdk why these normies who never had anxiety are fucking us nailbiters over
@StevenOwens1950 Xanax is lethal stuff. Don't think you can get hold of it legally in the UK anymore but in the 70s doctors did prescribe it sometimes and I took it for a few weeks to help me sleep as I was in tremendous pain after an accident. I couldn't get my head up from the pillow!
To fall asleep . I'm need,my Geodon to fall asleep
just got prescribed some xanax for the flight back and had the doctor give me specific instructions to listen to taylor swift before takeoff to make me happy while i‚Äôm spaced out why is this my life

@arahir honestly feelin like a xanax would be rly good right about now ! but water is fine too
@InfiniteChicken Deal. Please remind when it‚Äôs three am the Xanax might have taken over by then maybe.
@robinta89909237 @KgKathryn I had to take xanax, I am losing it. The wave was supposed to have been blue. WTF!?
@sadddsongs yeah i got thirsty so i drank the brine it was a bad idea so i had half a xanax and a very large glass of water
@gracehelbig @BetoORourke I found my Xanax earlier that I haven‚Äôt needed in a while and honestly thank GOD. Sending good thoughts to you lady.

@DrPhilOfficial Hi doc. Wanted you to know that Naltrexone is definitely helping.  I realize it is not a cure but it has allowed my body and mind a break. I‚Äôm an alcoholic with fibromyalgia and bipolar 2. I‚Äôm 71, been stabilized on fluoxetine since ‚Äò79. I have exceptional introspection!
I wish I knew the hype of college students taking adderall, I have adhd and it literally just stops me from impulsively buying $100 worth of air freshener and fidgeting
My heart is going faster than a humming bird on coke who just popped a vyvanse and chugged a coffee
How much Xanax did this @MSNBC crew take. They are way to happy.
Am I feeling better because of a Fox news projection or is it the xanax?
I need 87 Xanax or for someone to bash my head into a wall I‚Äôll take either
@RayndayGaming I need booze and junk food, followed by Prozac.
just finished spa yoga. preemptive xanax is in my system. I am ready to watch the returns. https://t.co/gv4FVHgy6E
I think i should run to CVS and grab some Xanax. This Beto O‚ÄôRourke race is giving me too many anxieties. So is Andrew Gillum!!
But I will keep fighting the Fascism of the GOP more then ever before!‚úäüèºThe only reason GOP keep winning key battles, is because of their gerrymandering and voter repression!I will gladly sacrifice my life to try to keep the liberal democracies around the world! *drops a Xanax*

Thank fuck I have 1 seroquel I can take if I need to sleep tonight
I found some Xanax in my bed took that shit went back to sleep
@jleblanc029 @AmandaSiebe @elizabethbrico @maiasz @PainPtFightBack Lol! Only pregnant women? Maybe on Mars. But no, it is an addiction medicine only prescribable (is that a word? It should be) by doctors who are either addiction specialists or took the suboxone/Subutex training. You can‚Äôt crush or inject it bc the Naloxone (opiate blocker)...
Google making me feel less crazy. The cipro does actually make me tired. üò¥ https://t.co/C7JeNClDn6
@Left_Side_Drive @jleblanc029 @elizabethbrico @maiasz @PainPtFightBack That's not true. Suboxone is prescribed all the time FOR CHRONIC PAIN.
Homeschool my kids, shell Chandlers, feed the animals, do the laundry, ACCEPT THE RESULTS and carry on LIKE A FUCKING ADULT....no screaming at the sky, no Xanax, no anxiety, no HATE.
Between Florida and Texas results I might need a Xanax to sleep it off #BetoForSenate #Beto4Texas #BlueWaveComing
@brycetache Just say NO! I've been eyeing my Xanax bars HARD!
I wish lyrica didn‚Äôt put her pregnancy on tv in the negative light they did , I believe she didn‚Äôt cheat on A1. Like they LOVE LOVE each other love and hip hop is wack franchise for trying to break up happy homes #LHHH
So overplayed, but also clever today.
@Swilua I took a xanax and a melatonin and am headed to bed to keep from crying
@LyssaDick ‚ÄúTake Prozac‚Äù Says the woman who chased you down and came into your work to yell at you for driving lol
I should really get my medication dosage up tho :/ and change from prozac. It fucks me up
@wilIholdontoyou the time i got drugged out on xanax: not click bait
Sticking with my new election night tradition: when the going gets tough, this tough woman takes a Xanax and goes to bed.
@jsatk Same. Not enough Xanax for this. Reliving my trauma from 2016.
Lol adderall tweaker @SteveKornacki is gonna smash his glitchy magic wall by the end of the night
@ClarkParkerxxx @ChurrosGamboa I have sleeping issues that even weed can't fix so if I want to sleep soundly without waking up for at least six hours, I take 100mg of trazodone. But it can make waking up feeling a lot like being drunk, lol. Sometimes just going to bed a few hours earlier can work well too.
@MonicaLewinsky In lieu of Xanax‚Ñ¢ will a self inflicted minor head trauma suffice? Tennessee has let me down.
He's an embarrassment to human beings.Nasty, vindictive, self-loathing, Prozac addicted fuckwit loser.No talent, no brains and NO COMPASSION.Demands that we suffer socialism/communism while he's made millions from his retarded films. #Hypocrite #Pathetic

@StevenOwens1950 Oops sorry! Almost 3am in the UK and my brain is in 90% shutdown! But what I tweeted about Xanax is true. I suffer with chronic insomnia but don't take any sleep aids. Did try aromatherapy but even with the bedroom smelling like a lavender field I was still awake!
Kornacki cam is like being in college again and seeing my roommate on adderall cramming for midterms in between sessions of FIFA.
Who yo man is off dat xanax have sum drunk sex yea
Curious whether all of the news anchors are also hopped up on Xanax and caffeine while pushing down the existential sense of dread in their stomachs?
@KryssiKakes Yeah I‚Äôm popping a Xanax. I‚Äôve had a stress stomach ache since this morning
I feel like I'm watching the 2016 world series (my cubbies) and the 2010 Stanley cup (Blackhawks) all over again AT THE SAME DAMN TIME.I NEED XANAX STAT
@lisastark351 I'm not drunk, I'm just messed up from xanaxüòÅüòÅüòÅ

@buckinblonde Except like he wouldn‚Äôt even go to the bar. He‚Äôd just pass out at home and make me think he was dead bc he had a habit of mixing anxiety meds, alcoholc, weed, and adderall.
KARNAKI'S MADE ME SODAMN NERVOUS, I FORGOT I HAD XANAX ! https://t.co/1wb1054Hbl
Watching CNN and John King is definitely the way to go .. he has been like Xanax while MSNBC and Kornacki is like a crack laced triple espresso.

@BadKidOscar I need a Xanax at this point. My heart is pounding.
@PreetBharara I had to take a Xanax. I take like 3 a year. My anxiety has been HIGH all day!!!
@GreatDismal @Klovharu OMG you made me smile at that. Needed it.Now: Back to my Xanax Salt Lick.

Okay. Okay. Okay. I am officially buckling down. Taking adderall. Purging any foods. Laxing. Going to gym 2 times a day. Sorry not sorry. ‚úåüèº
if I am ever famous I am going to leak my own nudes and blame it on alcohol and Xanax.
Days ago, I Tweeted the Blue Wave might not be the tsunami we hoped for. Trump is a master of turning the tide in his favor. So, I held out but I just reached for pharmaceuticals--Xanax--and the Beagle. Maybe a miracle will happen while I walk her. *sniff* tears fall.
*goes 60 seconds without adderall*My brain: https://t.co/D02yBh0pKL
Seriously though the MI-6 house results are so tight I am legit taking a xanax
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist https://t.co/PEKKPvNYgS Oct. 6 2018 - Me Me Cipro Survivor!!!
@HalpernAlex Seeing these election results makes me think that it is, in fact, the xanax
Arggh these tablets are fucking hell to withdraw fromIf your doctor ever suggests Lyrica or Gabapentin say FUCK OFF.
My internet is down and I have nothing to distract me from election anxiety. I already took a small bit of xanax to help keep me calm even though I've been trying to keep off it :&lt;
@randygdub I had a full-fledged panic attack, took a xanax, then checked a different site and was like "oh"
And I‚Äôm definitely not looking down at Xanax, booze, carbs, sugar, comfort food. Again, people vary, each situation is its own thing. If something is helping, fuck yeah. I just want us to have more options so we can reach for our favorites.
BIG FUCKING MOOD
Have a mumbling issue?Yes?You suffer from ADHD.This causes masturbation.Try Xanax
@IBDPassport It is an anxiety ridden struggle every 2 weeks when Humira time rolls around for my 8 year old. Every little bit of pain reduction helps and it would be devastating to go backwards on this matter. Let‚Äôs instead move forward toward a non-injection delivery method! A mom can dream.
I love vyvanse
This whiplash is killing me, should have taken a Xanax and gone to bed
The only thing keeping me sane is the fact that i get an adderall refill tomorrow so these emotions I‚Äôve suddenly grown overnight will be stifled and shoved away.
Shout out to Xanax for making today tolerable
@gavelar Well I would have brought my adderall to the panhandle a few weeks ago had I known it would take them so long to pull us through. PULL DAMN IT PULL! It's way past my bedtime and I HAVE to see the result.
@friggoffnancy Holy shit I did this this morning I drank a big cup of coffee right before taking a vyvanse and all day I was like üíîüíîüíîüíî
#Midterms2018 Damn how I miss my pre-retirement life in üíôNY!My current state of Florida is FUBAR.I expect it will eventually disappear under the toxic red tide ocean under toxic red leadership.Xanax, made it a double, and Netflix or Amazon Prime. Wish I drank.

@MrTimPatton this made me think of you...
The good news is, unlike 2016 election Im not ripping shots of tequila atm and probably won‚Äôt need Xanax to go to bed, bad news is, I wish I had more cake.
@ChuckWendig i actually do have prescribed xanax for my panic attacks but amazingly i have not had to use it yet today!!
@notscarlett I literally watched CNN for 5 minutes and started crying. Just can‚Äôt take it. No Xanax here, but have reverted to watching vet shows. Still feel nauseous.

@Bonkers1210 @WeldsChristie @blabbypain @afireinmyveins @mhtexyankee @ida_skibenes I'm smoking more green than cigs, truthfully.  I won't take Xanax when I'm cocktailing, for obvious reasons, and I'm still anxious af.
This adderall I took just makes me want to smoke cigarettes even more
Actually, Xanax or alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, not a opioid, and can be addictive but mainly only in high doses or‚Ä¶ ‚Äî i think i might take it tonight then idk but thank u https://t.co/ILXaFStv7X
@realDonaldTrump Dear whiners. Everyone knew the Dems would take the house. Cons kept the senate and beat the Left's top 3 gubernatorial candidates, not to mention Beto's punk ass. Stock up on tissues and xanax now, because the Trump train is rolling on until 2024.
I also took a vyvanse tonight to help pee all the illegal drugs out of my system.
Seroquel ftw

If I tell you that a young woman develops muscle weakness and mild hand tremors after an asthma attack, then you should check the electrolyte panel since albuterol might have been given and it causes potassium going inside cells causing these symptoms.

In addition to my prev. tweet Xanax addiction is not caused from marijuana it is due to the level of dosage from street or dr. And is an artificial seratonin booster which is why ppl become addicted. The same way ppl are addicted to carbs in food (also drugged) &amp; become obese.

If you want real harm reduction advice wrt Xanax, be wary of pressed bars because they are all fake in the UK. But I say this because they usually contain a higher alprazolam dose than 2mg or other benzos. The odds of getting one with fent are virtually non-existent.

1 dose of zoledronic acid (Zometa) costs ¬£200 to the #NHS. This drug is a bisphonphonate and is probably off patent (happy to be corrected). Alendronic acid, an off patent bisphosphonate costs pennies So the question patients should be asking, why the high cost?

Thinking back about the meltdown we all had for the O2 pre-sale, think of what it‚Äôll be like for the Spice Girls at Wembley. Hope everyone got the Xanax ready. This fangirl life is hard. https://t.co/66vJ8RIbu7
Don‚Äôt ask me questions that I can confuse myself with just refill my vyvanse and call it a day plz thanks
@molinahealth So not wanting to pay for Cymbalta and making me take Gabapentin instead put me in the ER. I thought not wanting Opiates was a good thing. Why do you think a drug with the same side effects is a good thing? https://t.co/O4sEazZRjz
@rejectedjokes we're eating xanax bars like hershey's
@HollyKai2 @Gatordoc @Angelsgal02 @maiasz @erbrod @filth_filler I agree, they are taking generic pain meds, demonziing them, forcing people on to Suboxone or the "NEW" brand name pain meds. It is disgusting!
Ended in wine, pizza and xanax. Way too much anxiety.
Hi @DrAmerSiddiqPsy How do i reduce my dependency on xanax? I used to take more than dose prescribed couple of times. Now, the normal dose dont work on me anymore, i feel more agitated and anxious. Tq
@byecarIy I‚Äôm literally laughing my ass off right now. How can someone be so fragile. Better pop an extra Xanax.
@ellesep Ya. I took two Xanax and two generous glasses of wine but am too stressed about getting an agent so no sleep - again. Ugh. Good thing we are not quittersüòé #Johnleephotography #ShotOnCanon #insomnia#brokenmirrorart #NYC #Fairfax https://t.co/DvguEkCAjk
@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Game? For Pete's sake, this isn't a game. These are our lives this grifter is playing with.  Just one more tweet from the President sounding like a junior high schooler bent on revenge. Thank goodness my Xanax hasn't completely worn off or I'd be yelling obscenities.

no doubt @SteveKornacki knows about adderall. Regardless of that...he has done an amazing job
@makaylol but fr tho addiction to caffeine is seen as a normal thing for some reason but addiction to nicotine or alcohol is completely different. i frequently see and hear ppl compare their vyvanse/addy habits to coffee and ppl wonder why ‚Äústudy drugs‚Äù become normalized
@EndTheStigma_ie I totally agree that antidepressants are linked to weight gain Aidan. As you know I was on Venlafaxine and Mirtazipine. Both cause weight gain. Since coming off Venlafaxine I have been able to loose a little weight. It's something we could really do without when we feel so low.
Tbh if I have one more dream about my ex, I'm gonna start blacking out on Xanax again so I'm too numb to feel anything üëç
@MonicaLewinsky I typed xanax enough that it is now a top suggestion in my predictive text. On a different note, thanks for being the awesome person you are.
@BC2M @PattiMurin Was afraid for years . Still kinda am but I am in cymbalta  and Wellbutrin and fighting hard
just sitting here tworked out on Adderall, grinding my teeth into dust thinking about the phrase "bipartisan marketplace of ideas"
@NiallOfficial @toomuchtoask A dr actually prescribed me trazodone &amp; that's been a HUGE help in keeping me from waking up in the middle of the night. Being able to stay asleep is the best!
@realDonaldTrump LOL. XANAX is a great drug, isn't it?
@JasonDurdenWSB @StopTheClot Sorry to hear that Jason. I've gone to the ER because I was short of breath and have been admitted and treated as I had an embolism. On Xarelto now because of it. I hope things go smoothly and well for you.
so you‚Äôre AWAKE awake
me on high doses of adderall: ok dude do your school workalso me: face masks. put on every face mask in your house.
Quick life update: Humira is a wonder drug and I feel like I'm getting a bit better and I don't know how to handle living life in a semi-functional body and also there is currently a pigeon staring at me through my office window, most likely judging me for my procrastination.

@Joel_Fritsma @PatriciaLabbe4 @AmyMek Poverty pimps. I just looked at results in calif where I‚Äôm embarrassed to say I live. The assholes passed a gas tax. Jesus where is my Xanax
@rileyslambo @ThisFreeLife Prozac has Fluoride as a main and active ingredient which is a poison.  Cigarettes the only time they are toxic is when they have either chemical herbicides and chemical pesticides.  Cancer did not start up until chemical pesticides and herbicides were made.  Read up on Monsanto.
@reinakatis To be fair to them she does take prescribed drugs. She takes Ritalin for her ADHD which is a banned substance, but what people don't understand is that it's only performance enhancing if you don't need it! It turns her brain into that of a normal person.

Is it bad to crave a Xanax?
@vvangopher The side effects of xanax were horrible for me.
My fucking flight just got delayed and now I‚Äôm stuck in Houston for 3 hours after taking a xanax
@kenninchitown They got people and places nobody's ever going to see again being used as guinea pigs to see what the side effects to Seroquel medication is
Xanax is like way better at managing my anxiety than lorazepam but Xanax makes my clit throb for no reason and it‚Äôs habit forming like is it even worth it

@TipsterGaming Xanax definitely helps me. I used to NEVER have panic attacks or anxiety but when I got both my legs amputated below the knee and now can't walk, I don't get around as much and I feel trapped. Like the walls are always closing in on me. A minute dosage of Xanax helps me cope.
@anyteaeye @JohannesPinina a running theory is that I was "meant" to be an ENTP who was subdued by Ritalin.
OK, this'll be interesting. Just cut myself for the first time since going on Apixaban blood thinning medication after getting that pesky clot in my lung in March.  Wonder how long the bleeding'll take to stop.

@theogany Everyone reacts differently. Is it for anxiety or depression!Lexapro didn't seem to do much for me. I don't remember Zoloft. Effexor was the silver bullet but some others say it didn't help them.I'm not compatible with Remeron (50 lb weight gain) or trazodone (dizzy/nausea)

@TipsterGaming Too much Xanax / Ativan and meds like it can also have the unexpected and unfortunate side effect of making your rectum loose (if you take too much). I've seen it happen at my dialysis place when a gentleman took to much and... well... had a little accident (and didn't remember).
I miss when rappers would stunt by rapping really fast xanax really outsold
@sirala6 @andylassner Could be. I mean, I have known people for whom coke calmed them down. Adderall is a stimulant which has the opposite effect on people with ADD.

@AngrierWHStaff Thanks for the commentary. I can't listen to him without xanax. I've got the volume muted.
@AngrierWHStaff Legit question - does he take Xanax willingly or do his handlers slip it into his diet Coke?
Trump came on the tv, and I tried to change the channel. After I discovered that I couldn't tune him out that way, I turned the tv off. I have loathed Trump since the 80s. I cannot even stand to hear his voice and over annunciation of every word. Blah!
@RRalstonAgile @AngrierWHStaff Xanax side effects are ugly for anyone without the correct chemistry. He's using Xanax like a downer (most folks do) so his heart would be in a depressed state and breathing more difficult. If breathing is difficult, then sweat and shaking could happen.
@ericsslater @DaddyIce2 @joanwalsh Is the Thorazine for counter acting the racism side effect brought on by Xanax?

@NORTHER64691120 @ABC He's got to balance out the Xanax man.
@benshapiro Can I get a screenshot? This woman blocked me. I must‚Äôve been shit-talking on Xanax bc I don‚Äôt remember lol
Bumped up the lamictal to 150 now, almost at the treatment dose I guess
@looptram prozac made me literally vibrate with anxiety so it‚Äôs def better to me. generally if you have anxiety they don‚Äôt wanna give you wellbutrin bc it does nothing for it / can make it worse but it hasn‚Äôt really been my experience (unless i forget to take it, withdrawals are bruuuutal)
Seriously does Don medicate himself? He looks as if he's on a couple of Xanax this morning. So weary of this tiresome man. Mumbo Jumbo on tax returns now. He's just so much more important and richer than everyone else. He's always under audit. You wouldn't understand.
I really can‚Äôt deal with my emotions right now. Too intense. I need a Xanax
@ChasingOzPhotog @99joemal Xanax. And took away his diet Coke.
.....i already took my adderall for the morning &amp; was waiting for class to start LOL time to listen to NCT &amp; work on homework I guess??? https://t.co/SmRXpHUMuL
@blood_slushie @Clozilla I have a horror story about a friend who was denied her Adderall prescription because she drank too much water and unexpectedly passed a drug test (that is, they couldn't detect it in her system so they assumed she was selling it).
ugh give me a ritalin script so i wont feel so tired and unfocused all the time, and also so that i can get a 2nd job to be able to survive
I‚Äôve always been against adderall  but I really feel like I need something to ever get anything done &amp; it scares me cuz I really don‚Äôt like medications but I‚Äôm kind of also ruining my life by doing nothing lol
@pfizer @MGHCancerCenter Thank you for helping ppl like me that can't afford lyrica. If it wasn't for you I would not be able to stand the way neuropathy has me on pain every day ty. I wish I could repay you some how. Plz let me know if I can
my ADD ass realizing the year long depression slump i thought was causing my inability to focus on things that interest me was just me not being on adderall https://t.co/bmL6sJi8fN
The Xanax is wearing off. Time to bring on the Haldol.
i‚Äôve been listening to Adderall for too long

Holy cow, how long does feeling like death on #humira last?I'm cool with my joints not aching all the time and my hair is finally coming back, but jesus fuck.... I'm tired of being tired.
@medeucea @PartinMatt Thought peep died from Xanax and alcohol shutting his liver down.
Donald's press conference is not going well! His Feather's are Ruffled!..Thank you CNN for your BRILLIANT REPORTERS!..THE GIRL TRYING TO SNATCH THE MIKE SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP ON ABUSE CHARGERS! HE NEEDS SOME XANAX! WATER PLEASE!
@drhallowell @Distraction_pod Why don't you say that Adderall is safer than aspirin anymore?
Slept 2.5 hours last night... so popped another adderall
@maggieNYT Someone needs to reevaluate Trump's Xanax dosage.
Adderall def not like this
@bolan183567 @KellyO @realDonaldTrump A fat, balding old man. On XANAX.
@EndTheStigma_ie I'm now on 250mg Quetiapine. Some nights it helps while others I'm awake at all hours üò≥

Just took my Xanax, going to smoke a joint and pass out .
Have an explosive temper?Yes?You suffer from Claustrophobia¬†.This causes a catatonic state.Try Paxil
Because he's nuts and probably suffering from a post xanax haze.

@CNN This is a mess and such a sad situation! What kind of leader treats people like this and is so disrespectful to people who are supposed to ask questions! Take a Xanax and pull up your big boy pants!
@cansncows @AnnoyedEMT Yess!!! We can‚Äôt even use bed rails unless family requests them because they‚Äôre restraints. We cant give more than 0.5mg Ativan at a time or 50mg seroquel. Restraints are for staff safety, whoever put those rules in place never worked a day on the floor
@tschenck55 He‚Äôs low energy until someone asks him something he doesn‚Äôt like. Then, he gets very angry, very quickly. He‚Äôs hopped up on something. I really believe he snorts Adderall.
Vyvanse with low dose strattera is amazing
@jimmykimmel y r trump's pupils so big? like it's midnight w/ no street lights    #adderall
@realDonaldTrump Xanax is wearing off.
@ThomasJWilson7 @LadyAg72 @Iamchronicpain @StarvinLarry @ChronicHLC @Shasta77777 @heatherzamm @process_x @AmaraAdvocate I was also referring to them for addiction &amp; have just heard many say Suboxone was harder to stop taking &amp; some were on for life too. I didn‚Äôt know you could get refills though. Wow.
@LindseyGrahamSC How about your boy's reliance on sleeping pills and amphetamines?  I think he took the Ritalin a little late, &amp; took too much, because his paranoia &amp; hostility are rising exponentially, right now.
@Pinche_Pi @lauferlaw I think the WH staff fed him the Xanax in secret. It explains why he wasn't tweeting yesterday. That, or they took his phone away from him.
my adderall isn‚Äôt motivating me the way it usually does so now i‚Äôm just ignoring my to do list with shaky hands this is fucked
@MalcolmNance He looks and sounds like he got run over by his own bus after a 72 hour ritalin cocktail!

It's been an overwhelming so I took my first Xanax.  Like the smallest dose I could get prescribed to me.  DAMN this stuff is not to be fucked with this is definitely going to be a take as needed break in case of emergency drug for me
I feel like...can I send y‚Äôall White House Correspondents anything:  like some Chamomile tea, or some tea biscuits, maybe some Xanax?  A sleep mask? Some slippers?   I honestly can‚Äôt see how you put up with this...
@grrrr_shark I‚Äôve never been formally diagnosed, but I have a leftover albuterol inhaler from my last bout with bronchitis and it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs helping.
@waltshaub He sounds and looks like he got run over by his own bus after a 72 ritalin cocktail!
Nixon 2.0 is in a bad mood today and in dire need of a hug and a xanax. #TrumpCrimeFamily
@failsonchud vyvanse and redbull is the heartpalpmax combo
My adderall dose got upped to 60mg a day.... i really am a whole deficient dumbass
@doublemaximus I was prescribed prozac &amp; trazadone. It takes some getting use to. Just know you're on the right path. It took me almost 20yrs to admit my anxiety.
Just heard back from my awesome Dr Ted Booker about my blood sugar numbers... He is dropping the Januvia from my diabetes meds!!!!  That only leaves Metformin.  That is 2 diabetes meds gone and only 1 to go!  Blood pressure meds, you are next!  #PRAISEGOD #AMAZING #GettingWELL
so don't hold your fucking breaths!I'm so done now. So beyond done.I am willing to jump through whatever hoops and do whatever it takes and they are like well there's nothing you can do.I'm taking three xanax when I get back from picking the kids up and I'm taking them
Keef off Xanax was an emotional song making god no one can compare
I get a reminder on the 7th of every month that it‚Äôs been X-amount of months since I‚Äôve taken a Xanax and it‚Äôs so refreshing to see how far I‚Äôve come getting off that shit
ADHD is a very real and very life crippling issue. I lose everything. I forget everything. I break everything. I can not control the volume of my voice. I am impulsive as FUCK. I know i make jokes about it but adderall has literally saved my professional and adult life
@GlitterBroker @grrrr_shark It's the time of year (colder air + stress) for asthma. Albuterol is a good rescue, but see a doc for a "puff test" and a listen to your lungs.

I dgaf re his 1040. I'd like to see the returns for all his shell corps - they must generate huge paper losses while filling the shareholders' pockets with cash treated as ROC, not taxable dividends. I'm salivating like a fucking bloodhound on Ritalin.
This is disgustingly shameful. Donald J Trump is the fattest sloppiest embarrassment this country could ever have. Fuck him and his Xanax drip-mouth double-speak spewing one-dimensional truncated lies over the podium.
when I woke up from this dream just now I couldn't remember exactly who was in it causing me to feel old "in love vibes". Turns out it was Xanax. #sleepdemons
@Acosta @MewllerRawr Depressed and despondent?  Wait until Mueller drops his next indictments.  There won't be enough Paxil in the world to help him.

@XboxSupport Microsoft, no worries. As long as all is fixed by the time I get home we're good. You see, #Xbox is my Xanax.
@AynRandPaulRyan @ResistanceParty Someone put him to bed!! Give home a shot of geodon!!!
Watching #realDonaldTrump on CNN. Press con running on and on. Trump having mood swings from cranky and rude to sleepy and slow. Xanax in his water bottle?
@BCBSIL I was not informed that the Walgreens I have been using was out of network for Humira. Neither by bcbs nor walgreens informed me. I am now stuck with a $2289.62 charge on my credit card. That's my mortgage payment. I need that reimbursed. Please advise.
Update: no terrible side effects. I felt quite relaxed and calm all day. Tidied up, did some work on my university assignment. Glad I took a day off work to test it, but so far the Ritalin seems to have helped. I‚Äôll test it at work tomorrow! #ADHD #autismawareness
my endocrine system: pleas.... a multi vitami nthe adderall about to go down my throat: a quien le dices vitamin tu, a mi me dices vitamin?
I started my meds last week. It'll take time for my body to start feeling better, but at least there's a light at the end of the tunnel now. I'll have to go for regular blood work and take synthroid for the rest of my life, but that's a pretty easy treatment.
Have difficulty making decisions?Yes?You suffer from Bipolar.This causes skin to turn orange.Try Paxil
xanax does wonders... i actually made a whole ass drawing in one hour without hating myself
@lyssquire I switched from Ritalin to addrall in high school. It made me a zombie. I hate it.
@jaccosted How do you feel little man?  You should stop going to these....you were shaking. Xanax only helps so much.
10:00 - take an adderall10:45 - I feel nothing. Take a second adderall. 12:06 - I am twitching with regret
me to my therapist: hey amber so why don‚Äôt you just prescribe me adderall, and then I can sell it and not be so financially unstable, like we‚Äôve talked about
LOL. Mr. Trump has been snorting adderall or coke again. He get‚Äôs aggressive and mean whenever he has the public speaking sniffles.
@snorfel1 @Acosta no medication. and if they did, his Fight Response of adrenaline is overpowering that XANAX. he needs a Horse dose
@realDonaldTrump jesus 4 hours of a break from twitter, when do you sleep???? go to sleep already you adderall crazied lunatic!!! #totaldick

Why pop xanax if you can just eat chicken pot pie
Yep. If I wasn't so worried about forming an addiction to Xanax, I'd be heading to the Dr today.FUCKING RACE BAITING AMERICA.
I started on the lowest dose of Adderall one month ago. Since then I've read 10 books. I don't think I've read this much since I was in high school.
Rightttt she was getting it
@quinncy @andylassner I'd suggest Zyprexa, because I don't think it's primarily an issue of anxiety, but of thought disorder.  Risperidone and Olanzapine would be good choices to manage his aggro behavior (it works well in other demented geriatric folks).

@christinaNYU @peterdaou On drugs, certainly. He looks like having been put on Xanax so that it limits the meltdown. And they forgot a spot with the orange paint.
@ venlafaxine buddy stop making me sick i know i‚Äôm ditching you for another drug but please !!!
Ok, my chest pains from massive anxiety attacks are subsiding a bit, so, go ahead and go off on me and my ranting, I can handle it, my Xanax is starting to do its job. And the world is still turning &amp; God has assured me all will be well in the long run. Still want to ü§Æ tho !!
Has anyone seen Melania today?  I worry about her having "kidney issues" before Trump was given his Xanax.
i made myself a whole ass beautiful lebanese lunch the tabbouleh has fuckin mint from my garden in it and the onions came from my great aunt's. i had two mouthfuls and im full gotta love that adderall suppressed hunger
Hi Doc @sindivanzyl  , is Pregabalin still considered / used in practice for the management of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy ?

@Lin_Manuel I have been up for three straight nights with one 11 year old girl whose coughing fits now were predicted by persistent croup as a baby/toddler. Soooo tired. Grateful for our nebulizer and albuterol and health insurance. Wish cough medicine worked.
@doublemaximus More power to you. I‚Äôm on paroxetine (paxil) for my anxiety. Started out rough, but once you get acclimated to the medication it really helps!
Not entirely sure if working out on adderall is good or bad for your health, but I do know it feels absolutely incredible.

1/? Ok twitter, Some questions for anyone who‚Äôs experienced withdrawals from antidepressants. I‚Äôve gone through withdrawals  a good handful of times just due to changes over the years. I‚Äôve been on Paxil twice and this is my second time coming off of it. I remember the first
Trump's  keepers really screwed up by letting @realDonaldTrump hold this press conference. The Xanax wore off &amp; then that train wrecked. What an addled, nasty, short-sighted, self-absorbed, ignorant man.Let the games begin, @HouseDemocrats.
Sometimes when i take adderall, my eye sockets hurt the next day.
@DomDockas Look I used to take Xanax too much like a LOT. Until my friends got sick and tired of it and confronted me about it. I haven‚Äôt touched Xanax in almost 2 years. Would I like to? Fuck yes. But guess what it‚Äôs my choice to not do so it‚Äôs my choice to not fuck up my life.
My cat is officially on Prozac, hopefully it helps. At first they gave us pills but they gave me liquid. I was stressing, trying to think about feeding him pills.
this alternative to anarchy requires far too much xanax

Why is  #NancyPelosi speaking with a big lozenge in her mouth? That and with the horrible sound system in the room made me put her on mute.
WH needs new rules on American journalists. If they act like spoiled ass disrespectful brats, then yank their WH passes. They can ask difficult questions, but show respect for the office of the President. Acosta is nothing more than a spoiled, showboating child. Ban him.

PML related to natalizumab (Tysabri) is detectable prior to symptoms in 32/41 (78%) of cases.  The authors advocate MRI surveillance, but a better approach in my opinion is avoiding the drug in high risk patients.  Asymptomatic PML is often overlooked. https://t.co/jaE69WVuiO

@Acosta Slowed down with Xanax or similar.
@realDonaldTrump I'm back, did you miss me?  I've thought about it.  Based on your "performance" at the press conference, I think it will be easier to invoke the 25th amendment than to have you impeached.  You are off the rails bat sh%t crazy.  Xanax wouldn't do a thing for you.

trump *has* to be on an ungodly amount of Adderall, right?
@TheQuartering You've literally admitted in one of your clips you wouldn't be able to function without antidepressants. And you said you had to pop Xanax during panel because of anxiety attack.

@hollygriffith @plezurluvr @hughfriknfraser @snorfel1 @Acosta I've had this conspiracy in my head that a common pharmaceutical like Adderall could cause brain damage in large populations, causing them to do unspeakable things like make Trump president.  It's probably just them being dumb, but I like to think maybe something damaged them.
Had a productive meeting with my GP and got my flu shot, a refill on my T prescription, and an increase in my Prozac dose which may make me feel better in the long run but will definitely make me feel worse to begin with, yay. Changing SSRI meds/doses is hell. üôÉ
OK so when they called my name at the pharmacy last night I thought it was to pay my $1 copay for Ativan and Vyvanse leave and go party but no it was to tell me I can either pay $900+ or leave bc Walgreens does not take my ghetto insurance and I was too distraught to do anything!

Adderall gets me through everything

Specifically Seroquel (quetiapine), which is also approved for bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant depression, and used off-label for anxiety and insomnia.TL;DR: greater risk than lamotrigine, far less risk than a valproate, comparable to topiramate.
@ziwe I was disappointed in many of last nights results and trying to avoid coverage today but damn if his reaction hasn‚Äôt changed my whole mood. He needs a XanaxüòÇ
If the fruit is made of Xanax and Risperdol, then yes, he needs a basket of that. I like the way Xanax makes him slur.

I think the Adderall buzz is keeping the tears at bay.
If you ever feel lonely or unloved just get an adderall prescription and friends you didn‚Äôt even know you had will start comin out the woodworks

@Ciaraioch I spent an hour and a half yesterday morning fixing shit after a lady was wrongly prescribed (and administered) 20 of someone else's meds in A&amp;E, including apixaban. I'm basically just a permanent bearer of bad news.

Gotta give A1 his respect cause lyrica would of been the quickest dub I ever had
@utopiadystopian @RRalstonAgile @AngrierWHStaff No. He could pass out if it's just xanax. He's not acting like there's only xanax rearing through him. He paced himself right (ü§¢) and did coke about an hour after xanax. Nasty combo, that. No wonder he looked so erratic and ill.
@_BrentEdwards in adderall we trust, am i right ? lol
@thespybrief How bumpy? Xanax bumpy?
there was this one day i took an adderall and smoked like two blunts and i was tweaking just like this when i got back home
Waiting for that vyvanse comedown is  like doing something bad as a kid n knowing ur gonna get ur ass beat once ur parents find out
runnin dangerously low on adderall
I am having a very interesting birthday. I thought it would be sort of boring and restful. It is neither boring nor restful. Note to self: Refill Xanax Rx.
I hate when I lay down for a nap then remember I took an adderall ten minutes ago; so I can just flush that idea out the window

@lindeeloo_who Same. After losing my son my anxiety and insomnia was uncontrollable. My doc, bless her heart, tried to get me to take Xanax , Ambien, and a multitude of anti-depressants as if a pill could make it better. We compromised w/Hydroxide and med mj. It doesn't fix it but it helps.
dont feel these vyvanse like i used to üòî
@AdrianNov89 @popstherock33 Both are legal controlled substances.  Adderall is the same thing as meth.  Lidocaine is a synthetic version of cocaine.  But hey man , put your money where your mouth is, and have your tooth pulled sober.

I'm definitely gone holla at lawyer asap I can't go for no probation I need THC in my system all day every day I refuse to go back to xanax cuz I can't smoke smh
@sameerjauhar Hi Sameer - I will always support nuance in these questions - agree that the variation means a single 'AD withdrawl' figure isnt particuarly helpful (and seems to mirror clinical practice - our kids get off fluoxetine pretty easily, adults struggle with paroxetine/venlafaxine)
@v_greyson do you get bizarre variation in meds effectiveness at the same dose from day to day? some days my Ritalin makes me my best self, some days it does absolutely nothing, and I can't figure out why. it's not sleep, it's not stress, I don't think it's hydration...
@RainbowStephan I was only on one at a time over 20+ years. I stopped Duloxetine two days ago. Only   20mg but it gave me TOTAL insomnia. It was like I had been given amphetamine. Anyway coming off it is equally sh1te. Such fun. %$#&amp;*?&amp; @=‚Ç©¬•.

Love you like my deranged minds to prescribed Prozac. Without it i am only an overwhelmingly miserable wrack.
Now we have to worry who the rotten cheeto will put into the Attorney General position. Could it get worse? Probably. Rotten cheeto is falling apart at the seams, he needs a xanax I think. Chill out man, take a breath, maybe a nap with a warm bottle &amp; start acting presidential.
say what you will about the failings of electoral politics, nothing gets the job done quite like a handful of xanax and a lukewarm glass of costco wine
y does caffeine make me sleepy :/ I need adderall :/ :/
@ChrisAikman2 @PsychRecovery Same reason poor little kids are prescribed Ritalin and anti-depressants that injure the brain- ignorance, inability to deal with children who are distressed or disruptive, and money.These drugs are addictive neurotoxins; they benefit no one.
@seandanaher5 @ottocrat MEP for the Border constituency in between the two running for the Spitzenkandid√§t in pole position, both happy out to be associated with her.The sort of thing that should have sensible people in the FCO of whom the impossible is being demanded crunching Xanax like Tic-Tacs.

You‚Äôre 15 going to parties. Look at your pinned tweet on your main account. Your ass is out. You talked about smoking weed and taking Xanax. Just tweeted about getting suspended from school. You‚Äôre 15....but I‚Äôm immature? You‚Äôll learn one day. Fuck off
@JustClouded How do people even compare Xanax to fentanyl though? Xanax just makes you calm tf down, fentanyl kills you. Literally takes a sprinkle of it to be deadly.
Me walking up to pharmacy counter: Hello, may I please have 1 ‚òùüèΩ bucket of Xanax? Thank you.
*gets adderall jitters way past the time it should have worn off*me: ???*realizes its bc i forgot to eat today*me:    :O
@chrislhayes Don't worry, your side will go belly up fast when the SHTF. Stock up on pot, Prozac and pain killers. It will all seem üëå
Xanax completely reworks how your mind works though üòÖ yeah it doesnt kill you but it kills the old you... I mean I've done extensive research on it and I dont think it should be used to help treat anxiety but to each their own üôè
I just want to say thank you to Ritalin for getting me through this day
Nursing school is: taking an adderall and being able to take a nap regardless
@mjfree Its those 72 hour Ritalin laced cocktails that made him do it! Just say'n
My doctor immediately started my appointment by asking about my sobriety then gave me the flu shot and he heard my heart murmur as a result of my taking Trazodone and he immediately cut me off it and we‚Äôre experimenting this for a month unless I‚Äôm in rehab by then
@realDonaldTrump We couldn't have 1 day. One got dayem day of peace from your fkng freak show. Man, go smoke some weed and take a Xanax or 20 and wash that shit down with a couple Jack and cokes and a tall glass of shut the fk up.  Thanks in advance.
@EbThen apparently my blood pressure too close to the high end of fine for something like Ritalin üòû
@ECMcLaughlin @MSNBC I‚Äôm so tired of stress eating, drinking, Xanax-ing. I‚Äôve decided approach this as watching the house burn to the ground. I want Trump in ashes.

@PaigeNichole_ Yeah but what I‚Äôm saying is fentanyl just isn‚Äôt a commonly used cut in COCAINE, heroin absolutely, Xanax absolutely, but an upper? It literally makes 0 sense
wonder what would happen if I took pre workout on adderall
@JustClouded I‚Äôve never taken it by being prescribed it. I personally don‚Äôt like anything that makes me feel like I‚Äôm not living in reality. Xanax, klonopin, Valium, don‚Äôt like any of em. Figured out how to calm myself down on my own. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

@PatFitzsimmon11 @ScienceNews No that's a lie. They give kids Ritalin and addicting anti depression meds that you need to be weaned off of, that's what causes the brain damage.
so I take a billion pills every day and I just keep them in a weekly caddy, and tonight when I took them I got the very very distinct taste of xanax, which I'm uhhh, too familiar with. I haven't had any for a couple years but my parents have the bottle (more of a tub...) that
was left after I weened myself off it, so I know the pills exist somewhere.but like, I don't know if it's psychosomatic or what but it really feels like I took a low dose of xanax... idk, I don't mind too much, but I'd like to know, just in case, right?
@karaswisher Seems like staff accidentally mixed in a little meth with Trump's morning dose of Xanax.  More batty than usual at the presser today.

@Doodlekitty @Bethdevine18 @PalmerReport Again, tRump didn‚Äôt have more than 4 hours of sleep last night based on his tweets, plus he‚Äôs addicted to cocaine and Xanax in order to keep up. He‚Äôs a clear and present danger to the world.
@poliakoff73 @ParisUS2411 @chrislhayes Xanax is not typically given by IV-would be counterproductive to be ‚Äúhooked up‚Äù to short-acting benzodiazepine like alprazolam for any reason but immediate control of seizures rather than a longer-acting benzo for persistent anxiety. Ativan/lorazepam usually preferred for IV use.
There's this one mosquito in my room, that somehow managed to survive till mid november. The only reason it lives, is because it sucks me dry every night like a queer furry on adderall.
@LiLBoWeep "Not encouraging drug use." &gt;proceeds to give drug users safer ways to do drugs, thus promoting more drug use because they are under the assumption that they are safe. "Xanax won't kill you." Cracked me up buddy. Anti anxiety medicines can put you into cardiac arrest.
@EricaHartmann88 @AndrewQuackson The soy thing is a meme, antipsychotics like Geodon cause gynecomastia.
@GraceReport Mine is thyroid related. I cut gluten and it helped tremendously. No idea if that would help. Also, i was on Ritalin for awhile. It helped tremendously. (Eliminating gluten has been the biggest help, though. )

@doublemaximus If you can make it 6 weeks through it, it DOES subside if you consistently take it at the same time daily. When I was on it (I changed to Effexor), Initially my side effects were not subsiding so instead of taking it in the evenings, my doc suggested mornings and it worked ‚úåüèª

My anxiety is so fucking bad rn somebody pass me a Xanax before I loose my shit
It's like the arch of a movie, where everything goes bad for the good guts. Only it's is real life Xanax kind of days now @matthewamiller: @MollyJongFast you should be stressed out! I don‚Äôt think people get what a national emergency this is.
@Ku_Beans @medeucea @PartinMatt So his doctor laced his Xanax that he was taking (abusing) nahhh bullshit. You could take 1000 mg of Xanax and not overdose but the second you take a sip of alcohol you‚Äôll die.
give me jewelry shaped like adderall so i know it's real ?? https://t.co/HHmF4rD6iH
@thatssocolin_ @medeucea @PartinMatt The xanax wasn‚Äôt from his doctor. Who said anything about this being a prescription-related overdose? It was fentanyl-laced xanax from some random drug dealer. Fentanyl-laced drugs are everywhere.
Amaya's face is how I feel.Barely holding it together but still smiling. My anxiety creeps in, trying to function in the cluttered chaos of moving boxes.Send wine...and maybe a Xanax.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢#amayaadventures #childhoodunplugged #documentyourdays ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/TLYH7kbpMB https://t.co/qzNJWF14Ix

I have permanent damage from Lyrica. I now have high blood pressure and edema. I took it for TWO DAYS, my feet and legs blew up to 4-5x normal size. They were enormous. I take lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide to control for side effects of Lyrica I took 8-9 yrs ago.
ye gods, forgive me for I have just popped homework ritalin and am now playing fortnite with this power ye have bestowed upon me
Mueller, where the fuck are you????!!! Trump is trying to do Nixon on Adovan, Ambien, and Xanax. While god damned tweeting!!! Who is left?? The Supreme Court is dangling on RBGs health and now this blatant obstruction? Wait till the new guy finds Mueller to be "a waste"üò≠üíÄüëΩ
it's too bad my psych didn't prescribe me sum mfin xanax bc a bitch need that shit
@justWillSmith1 I have been on citalopram, sertraline, and duloxetine... all made me a zombie and had other side effects... I just need to wait for weed to be legal üòÇüòÇ
@realDonaldTrump @KatrinaPierson I'll be the 1st to tell you, for all the worthless drugs like Cymbalta, Lyrica, Neurontin the so-called anesthesiologist/pain doctors order for $600.00/visit for neuropathy=nerve pain, that don't work medicinal marijuana does!!! Neuropathy feels like the worse toothache you ever
Prozac eyes is a finding of increased eye movements (both slow and rapid) during NREM sleep that is associated with the use of SSRIs. It doesn‚Äôt mean anything clinically but a cool finding nonetheless! #sleepnerd #sleepmedicine #psg #N2 #spindles #itsnotrem https://t.co/dtcY89TecY
Tomorrow is my 14th dose of #Cymbalta. I've gotta say that the only lingering side effect I notice is insomnia. I'm really hoping that wears off, because I feel like I'm getting sick and I know I need rest to fight illness. Aside from that, the NO nerve pain thing is fantastic. https://t.co/0BIYu7LYFi
College really got my doctor prescribing me Adderall XR
me trying to do well this semester without adderall is a struggle...I feel like a crackhead who needs a fix
the come down from vyvanse is just awful, wouldn‚Äôt recommend
@whirledpeas4me I take Cymbalta, it helps me sleep also.
voice it doesn't make what you are saying right. So lower your voice, take a Xanax and go to sleep.
@JayceLad @paginaskinner @shanedawson Lotta people getting laced with fent when they think they‚Äôre taking Xanax lately so better just be safe
Might drop vyvanse and make a new twitter account
@PressSec Honest question: how many mg of Xanax does it take for you to fall asleep at night?
@OneLuckyGay As someone on suboxone- I don‚Äôt understand. People are dying everyday, children are being thrown into CPS, and homelessness grows all because of this crisis. So sad!
i was serious about that adderall shit bruh i have 4 2k+ word essays due on the same fucking day hit me up
Have bad breath?You probably have Autophilia.This causes masturbation.Try Adderall
@Warzone_Maniac @PressSec @Warzone_Maniac doesn't sound very happy about the tiny blue wave. Poor thing, maybe Dr. X. will up his Prozac dosage. LOL!!!
She got good taste! At least she ain‚Äôt on Lil Xanax or any of those weirdos.
Pls be safe... fentanyl is not a joke, shit is being mixed in and it‚Äôs deadly it‚Äôs stronger than Heroin and it takes the smallest amount to kill you. Stay away from coke and laced Xanax.

My post doc applications are due this weekend and not even a Xanax can calm my anxiety
It's been over a week since my allergic reaction to Geodon and I still have negative effects. I've been unable to leave the house, let alone, the couch and its times like this when I feel an overwhelming desire to give up, and go live in a nursing home somewhere,
zoloft was a JOKE i have NEVER felt happier and more myself than rn on prozac (besides my lungs hurting) i am 60% blessed ü•∞
Lol my brother knows when I‚Äôm on adderall cos I talk a lot
I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt do dumb shit like coke and xanax anymore. I really thought I was doing something, doing those drugs for fun. It‚Äôs all fun until your health is at risk and trust me, none of that shit is worth it. The shit I had to go through bc I used those drugs. Not worth it.
Update on stream: I took a Xanax and a bath because anxiety and now I‚Äôm in bed with a book. I wanted to play games but I honestly think I need a total day off. I still love you though ‚ù§Ô∏è
throw back of me being thicc and off half a xanax bar https://t.co/AqSDC8CnWc
@RhapsodieShep you'll ne taking synthroid supplements then?

he.....didn't???? he lowered his arm into her arm while she was trying to rip the mic from him???? you can argue she's just doing her job insofar as she's carrying water for an authoritarian maniac. god i need a xanax
@bobssoninlaw @mfwilliard @jeanpmuller @RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept Poor guy....get off  the Adderall.... https://t.co/1KSr9RyWYz

Miss one day of Seroquel and I'm depressed. I only have a half pill left. I'm not well in the head.
@megan_yates1 Girl I‚Äôm dying no lie üòÇüò≠ but I got every hookup known to man.. I got the kombucha, antibiotics, lemon water, tamiflu, elderberry syrup like if I don‚Äôt feel better by tomorrow something is wrong üòÇ
@realDonaldTrump CRIMINAL IN CHARGE IS PANNICKING!  Xanax helps with panic attacks. Take a whole bottle and a few shots of tequila and u will b fine
Can anyone tell I didn‚Äôt take my vyvanse today and just had m&amp;ms for dinner
My fav thing about when I used to pop adderall/Ritalin like it was candy is that I was never ever hungry. I lived off of wine and pills. It was glorious.
@aparna_ramen @GinaMcGalliard I have an undxed sleep disorder as well. It's treated somewhat w/trazodone atm. I refer to it as insomnia for simplification's sake, but it's so much more. My uh....My circadian doesn't rhythm lol.
Chy why Lyrica just couldn‚Äôt plug up her phone at this renewal ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@SNOOPWAIFU blues.. hm... i guess some kind of downer maybe like xanax or some shit
@magnidoddle @ive_ga @RyanPowellSmith @BBCWorld How so Denise? Pop another XANAX and flesh out that dog shit reply
@aparna_ramen @GinaMcGalliard Before trazodone sometimes I'd be completely nocturnal. Sometimes I'd sleep for 3 days. Other times I'd be awake for 3. I was all over the place in every way and even when I got a good night's sleep, it would feel like I hadn't slept at all.
Apparently I do things in my sleep (pretty regularly) with no recollection of doing them.. üò¨üí¶...and I didn‚Äôt even take a Xanax last night. #SleepTease https://t.co/J0Pooe1sYv
It's the truth paxil. @Acosta inappropriately touched a White House Staffer.She never laid a hand on him.It's all on video.
@cammiescott Xanax and Klonopin. I think sometimes people are adverse to medication for mental health issues but to me the brain is just another organ and mine doesn't make the correct amount of a particular chemical and the medication fixes that. To me it is no different than a diabetic
I wonder if kitty Prozac would make me this friendly. #thecatishigh https://t.co/NgaCgo7r4S
@AceWhitehouse1 Works for most i xanax
Say it louder for them dead ass adderall zombies in the back üó£
@SNOOPWAIFU @cutelittlepunk SHE SAID BLUE SO MAYBE SOME TYPE OF XANAX I SAID YES FOOTBALLS BECAUSE THEY ARE A BLUE XANAX DONT MAKE ME FEEL CRAZY
Having long joked about the possibility, I've just managed to inadvertently take one of the dog's anti-anxiety pills. Let's see if 20mg of fluoxetine makes me less inclined to bark at passers by. It was pleasantly aniseed flavoured BTW.
Seen a dude at Carl‚Äôs Jr. dead asleep on his burger like that shit was a pillow n his drink spilled on his lap. Xanax is one hell of a drug.

I need to double my quetiapine cos my moods so low and my sleeps horrendous
@PatB90739861 Hehe! I predict you‚Äôll be fine.....it‚Äôs Prozac. Avoid driving/cycling/biking /using chainsaws, etc, for the day, though‚Äîjust in case it makes you drowsy.
Have unwanted hair growth?You probably have Dyslexia.This causes blood clots.Try Adderall

@NBCChicagoMed Chicago Med has me all tensed up and I might need a Xanax and some counseling sessions with Dr. Charles #ChicagoMed

@AutumnKing27 Did you get the steroid shot?? They wouldn‚Äôt give me tamiflu becaus my dumb ass didn‚Äôt go until I had already had it for 3 days
Sometimes I get so dehydrated that it‚Äôs all I can think about, thanks Prozac
He is getting EXACTLY what he deserves and is STILL trying to be the victim. He is unstable and should cut down on the adderall.
Just took an adderall at 8pm because of my crushing work load üíÄ
bro's home. he should have the tablets for Liza with him and she can up her dose of prozac tonight
@bijancbayne @danibostick @Acosta Baby girl, take a xanax. You seem tense.
@cs00582scs @ST7757 @CNN @OTEZLA @TMobile @GEICO @Progressive @humira @Nutrisystem @BMW @NordVPN @ATT @GoodRx Acosta was so beyond rude, he deliberately provoked president Trump, had nothing to do with free press ‚Äîsheer bullying.
So, I‚Äôd always known that CBD helps ‚Äúmanage‚Äù symptoms of anxiety, but I had never looked into why. It‚Äôs seriously crazy. Unless I‚Äôm completely misunderstanding, unlike many big pharm medications (Prozac), it doesn‚Äôt just cover the symptoms. It literally helps cure it.
@_michaelaah i was taking Lamictal which is a mood stabilizer
So I went to grab my melatonin bottle so I could sleep, but I subconsciously grabbed my Adderall.. I FREAKING TOOK MY ADDERALL INSTEAD OF MELATONIN
omg can the doctors please give me xanax through the drip like someone knock me out fully am not a functional person with 5 hours sleep since 6am friday

Ya know, you‚Äôd think taking Xanax, smoking weed and drinking multiple glasses of whiskey all at the same time would get me to stop hating all you shitiots, but alas, my struggle continues.

@QueenE86 @violet_heartin Haha will def let you know. My hubs is in construction so we have a good hook up in ny, probably could get the more serious stuff but I've been happy with my weed and xanax. Hard stuff seems like killer vacation recreation tho

Stop it. Acosta doesn't matter. This is the dumbest, most blatant distraction yet. Acosta is not worth it. Focus, Democrats. Do you need some Ritalin?
hey gamers wehn non-ADD people say they get a hold of adderall Magically because they just feel like it How Exactly does the Get The Drug process go.          Not That I Think I Need Addera
Got prescribed Vyvanse 40mg and Topamax 25mh
@GeorgeH39538689 @Acosta Take your own advice George....  Wow man, look at that donkey falling outta Acosta's ass!  Oh snap, toooooo much Xanax.  Nobody gets to treat the president like that.  Ye reap what ye sow....

@PressSec Wow sad how you just go along with things. It's got to be Prozac your on ,as it causes one's sense to dull

Bad day? @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt worry. More bad days ahead. Renew the Xanax.
Looks like Grandpa forgot to take his dose of Xanax last night :P
@RJNieder @AUGoldMine See thats the problem with the negative nancy attitude. If Auburn wins out, Gus sticks. If Auburn loses out, Gus stinks. Hate to tell you but if the only time youre going be happy is during Championship seasons you better keep the Xanax near by. AU won 3 SECC in the last 25 years

@skullmandible Dude I feel you I went three months off my adderall last. It was hell.
@BourbonGhost Look at you getting all upset. Lol. Good Lord. Take a Xanax and chill out.
Xanax is for old people tryna cope with death.. u young!! what kinda anxiety u running from?
@Acosta https://t.co/VFAP2KBHYqHere is the Video you need to ease up on the adderall
#Suboxone seems like 'the answer' to #opioid #addiction. But some experiences may also indicate caution. "Box Wars" https://t.co/jMNhb9OpEa https://t.co/AzPt8ZoWkh
I have a bias against Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).When I was young, a doctor recommended I take Xanax to control my mood swings. Both my parents were against this. When I asked my mother, an LVN, she said Xanax can have bad side-effects from withdrawal.
There are a lot of very nervous, powerful people who are not sleeping well right now. They were accustomed to doing whatever they wanted, with no concern for us, the Proud American Public. Now they are rightfully scared of the unknown.  Currently eating Xanax like Tic Tacs
me: *takes a sip of redbull*anyone: *takes 3 shots of tequila, snorts a bump of coke and lights up five cigarettes at once* ‚Äúew you know rebull is like really bad for you??? I would never put that in my body‚Äù *pops a xanax they bought out of a honda civic in the parking lot*
the comedown of the medicine i‚Äôve been taking lately (adderall xr) is so fucking bad for me :/ i‚Äôve only been taking it for 3 days and it‚Äôs given me horrible mood swings. I‚Äôll be really happy and peppy and then get so sad that i‚Äôll get suicidal thoughts??
@ros_tinkler @RainbowStephan Thanks for your concern though. The worst withdrawal I had was with Prozac. Absolutely horrible. The biggest problem now is insomnia.
I do think certain individuals do need SSRIs, while I think others do not. The problem is that SSRIs, like Ritalin or Xanax, affect different people in different ways and can be abused, misused or taken badly.I think it's important to weigh options when considering SSRI's.
@krassenstein 70Million and he couldnt beat @tedcruz Blaaaaaaaahahahahaha Adderall is damaging your brain
As a result, I was never given Xanax or any other SSRI (though I did go to therapy and family counseling which helped me a great deal).
