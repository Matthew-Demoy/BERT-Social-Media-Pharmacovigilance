I've got inflammation, but it only occasionally flares to high levels. Still get a lot of pain &amp; fatigue tho &amp; you're right: we'd have just been a nuisance! I had to have a hard talk with myself!

1054118305538211840	526575903	https://t.co/smuo8RkVbKMaybe this is part of the problem?Could also be the fact that they drugged my generation at younger and younger ages.  Teachers wanted my brother on Ritalin at 7. My mom cut his sugar intake, put him in karate and started him on the Sax.
1054118308226781185	526575903	On the other hand, My cousin Nick was on Ritalin from the age of 4 to 23. Even 5 years after he stopped He's never held a job over 6 months, has 5 kids, and says he's Homo Occulta, the newest evolution of mankind. All while living on welfare.

1055825389002674176	989940502748377088	About 1/4 of the total efficacy/safety events occurred in the 75+ year old population. Xarelto plus aspirin wasn't better than aspirin alone for the efficacy outcome in this subgroup analysis and was associated with more bleeds (exploratory still)
1055825388109217792	989940502748377088	However, it seems like this would be a great population to risk-stratify with the new FDA approval of Xarelto post-ACS. A look through a few of the subgroup analyses in COMPASS (explicitly mentioned as exploratory, by the way) shows a few first steps here.
1055825389891792897	989940502748377088	Another possible group to avoid could be those without underlying hyperlipidemia. Though there were not many events in this group (just under 10%), addition of Xarelto was not associated with improved efficacy and was associated with increased risk of bleeds.

1055847554011799557	258104992	@A_dmg04 2mg xanax. Srsly takes the edge off w/o making you "high" or a zombie. I've got really bad anxiety about the "what ifs" when it comes to bad stuff happening. I'm so focused on keeping my family safe that I neglect my own well being. The pill helps me help them more effectively.

It is largely distrust and a disconnect from others.  I think it will take at least a generation.  First, get rid of fake news which creates anxiety.  Then change the school system.

1055902686942584832	3439355824	@Thomma66 the reason was that the fluoxetine seemed to make me worse than the actual depression - i literally couldn't function.Sometimes you just aren't in the right place to speak to anyone...no matter how close!Sorry for your loss, but there is a #mentalhealth explosion currently.
1055902715811753986	1007196878	How tf do people who aren’t prescribed adderall and vyvanse talk about it so casually. They make it seem like no biggie and then people who’ve never had it take a small dosage thinking no big deal and start having heart palpitations and think they’ll die. #askingforafriend

Which is basically true of pretty much all mental disorders

1056265788498329605	2344979311	@Deano98_ mate wtf you on a high dose of Adderall or something
1056265928504041472	1025897411619610625	@FioraAeterna In my limited experience with Vyvanse, it lasts an hour or two longer than Adderall XR

1056265987954262017	190866892	@JSanford301 @RealGarrettCarr @allthemoneymc You do realize I know how suboxone works, what its components are, why it’s prescribed correct? That I know what the mental conditions you listed entail, correct? I also know what psychiatrists stated about him. I also have the adverse event profile of the drug with percentages
1056266238085730306	830485527996559361	@EqualityCouple @CDCgov Ya think? They get excited when it's time to market a drug. Not only is it time for lucrative flu shots, but the FDA just approved a new flu treatment medicine. Put out alarmist numbers to create a market. New pain meds in pipeline, lots of Suboxone to sell to addicts.
1056266306545172481	327151865	@bourellies thank u so much for sharing! i too have OCD and was given prozac first — it didn’t personally work for me and if you get a chance to try wellbutrin+lexapro I’d highly recommend! much solidarity friend.

1056266446706139136	1118460332	@ddale8 oh my God. His speechwriters must use Xanax like tic tacs at these things!!!
1056266527006187520	190866892	@JSanford301 @RealGarrettCarr @allthemoneymc So yes, I’m telling you that based on his psychiatrists, the data, the indication for the drug, and the rarity of any side effects like irritability, that your theory linking suboxone to the shooting holds very, very little water. I’ll trust things like UpToDate over infowars

Ritalin also depart from the body slowly, which makes it less addicting. I’m not sure how I feel about this☝️What do you think? #adhd

But these drugs stimulate the parts of the brain needed for impulse control, focus, and organization.

Does not mean that is bad or good, just stating facts. Also MDMA shows many promising uses in a therapeutic sense. Basically, moderation is key to anything.

1057222089265106944	369629573	I thought Klonopin was an SSRI for some reason. I didn't realize it was in the same family as Xanax and Valium. It's crazy how addicting these drugs are, and how freely doctors prescribe them. Honestly, SSRI's take longer to become effective, but highly recommend.
1057222147167477760	40797702	This time yesterday I backed into my brothers car. This morning I spent 3 hours at the animal hospital with my dog and had to leave her there. I need a Xanax and a nap
1057222389463953408	369629573	I totally understand that people are prescribed Xanax and Klonopin for ongoing panic attacks, but having that as an emergency backup while taking an SSRI seems like the safest route (according to friends and my own doctor.) Glad people are talking about this!!

1057254738801123328	193508679	Ran out of adderall because I'm trying to ask my psych why he switched to a brand that cost 3x as much. But he basically only works one day per month. I thought my feeling awake was due to my anti anxiety meds providing me with me sleep. But apparently it was not. So exhausted.

1057255484971982848	193508679	Also I'm really hungry without the appetite suppressant of adderall. Which makes everything miserable, because all I can concentrate on is wishing I had food. And the office is cold today. Basically I'm just miserable all over. I want to go hide in a hole and never come out.

1057260053353263110	1031264466	@ourpainsreal I had excellent results with fosamax 40mg a day for 8 weeks for my CRPS. It reduces pain from touch, and bone pain while strengthening bones. Have you tried that? I still have pain but less. I have done that twice now. Seems to last about a year to 18 months.

1057260919657512960	2248389312	@SGottliebFDA The opioid crisis has already hit America. Pain pills r no longer the problem. It’s almost impossible to get anything for pain from a dr. Now we just have many Americans turning to heroine, fentanyl, &amp; basement made “fent”. The fda should make suboxone/naloxone more affordable.
1057260992281894912	1024119035259170816	Lyrica all you need to do is focus on your bundle of joy and your music and husband, because nobody is perfect do what y’all both messed up and now y’all working on it, you need to tell the haters to kiss 💋 where the sun don’t shine.
1057261074439946246	20807698	@AnnCoulter So, Ann, what do you think is making Trump sniffle more frequently at public appearances and interviews? I suspect Adderall. That would be consistent with the blathering, impulsivity, and flight of ideas. Note the pupil size.Trump-B-Usin'

1057261126453362688	1031264466	@ourpainsreal I will warn you that it can cause gastric ulcers. Make sure to use a stomach protection like nexium daily at prescription strength 40mg daily. Google fosamax and CRPS and you will find studies about it. Feel better. I think your therapist is a jerk.

1059247322444382208	1135732904	@funrama So are you! I don't know how you manage w/o Lyrica or another nerve pain medication. (Not neurontin, we both know that's just a recipe for brain fog &amp; fatigue.) I'm glad you posted about your new nerve pain. It's hard to ask for info, sometimes, especially when it's so personal.
