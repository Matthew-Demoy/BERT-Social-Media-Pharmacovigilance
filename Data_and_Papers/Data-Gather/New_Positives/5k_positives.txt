Orrrrr you can just take Adderall
Valium, Xanax I’m going to need something because I’m already starting to freak out
I know Edge Day was yesterday, but I’m happy to report that I’ve been accidentally taking half my prescribed dosage of adderall for my ADHD. #edgetildeath #bayareastr8edj
My chilli just took a vyvanse.
LMFAOOOOOO DO YOUR THING NATURAL SELECTION
Bro it’s EVERYWHERE
Y’all are so down on wearing pants. For me that shits like taking Adderall. Like yes, now I’m gonna be productive. Or sit on the couch anyway, but be slightly more uncomfortable and sweaty.
Taking lyrica during the day time is weird. I feel like a zombie
@mikachu Makes sense. I got mine at 1.5 years so his separation anxiety was/is bad. But the Prozac is helping!
@KellKe11 Seroquel gets me enough sleep to get by.  But if I forget just one dose, it's nightmare insomnia.
went to the doctor for chest pain &amp; left w medicine for my chest pain, back on my prozac, &amp; some sleeping meds. also got a flu shot &amp; had to get blood drawn but my veins collapsed in both arms so that’s cool 👍🏻
@MrQuaDriller i feel like the backlit devices one is really what’s screwing me over because other than that i 1) can’t consume more than one cup of coffee a day because RITALIN, 2) don’t sleep during the day, because RITALIN, 3) don’t drink alcohol during the week, because acid reflux
Tomorrow night I start the switch from seroquel to seroquel XR. A little nervous just because of how my mood has been lately.
@MrQuaDriller (caused by RITALIN) and so really the only option left to me is my phone.
@PulmCrit @fjaffer88 For everyone? I tend to use Seroquel if they're delirious.
my adderall kicked in rn in class https://t.co/rb8Fqga2d1
Jesus Christ this thread. The fucking nasonex bee making me weep.
@sk8ie i’ve had bad heart burn for two weeks straight so i went in to a new family doc &amp; in the paperwork i had to check off depression &amp; anxiety &amp; so she put me back on prozac &amp; I don’t sleep thru the night so now i’m on sleeping meds
Hour 32 of being awake and I just bought 3 60 MG Vyvanse I’m going on a spiritual journey to stay awake for 4 days and see how much my body can take

Ok. I am thinking this flare might be waning a little. Not like "no pain" but like I am gasping and yelping less. I will take that. Back to pregabalin tonight.
@DoctorChristian I was prescribed tamiflu during the first swine flu outbreak (all those years ago). I developed a severe headache and stomach pains approx 1 hr after each pill. I felt dreadful. I thought it was the flu at first. awful stuff
I might fuck her off a xanax.
My albuterol prescription is ready @cvspharmacy. (I had my flu shot on Tuesday.) Off I go to get it. Until then, people. 😊
Fuck xanax.
Y’all have been persecuting vegans this whole time when the vyvanse hits.

@DrMel_T Damn, same here! I’m on 50-100mg seroquel at night otherwise I can’t shut my brain off. It takes a long time to get going in the morning. I don’t feel ‘myself’ again until early evening. But yeah my brain goes into overdrive otherwise and I can stop “doing stuff”.
@ARIESTHEREYET omg i stopped taking my adderall inhigh school havent been the same since x
A motorist driving a car with only three wheels was charged with DUI this morning in suburban Riverside. The driver allegedly told police he had taken Xanax with alcohol before getting behind the wheel. https://t.co/fpjsGEFwZh
I was waiting for Brandon to get Adderall for me to focus. I was having a hard time. Already
aaaalllso I may or may not be insanely stressed out right now because I'm down to 11 dexedrine tablets and I still have no idea when I'll be getting my refill of adderall. This is a confounded mess of a situation.

My dad has three broken ribs, internal bleeding, and a blood clot.. he couldn’t be more happier high on Xanax right now
My fav thing about adderall is that I’m v dehydrated so even though I’ve been violently crying for 30 min I haven’t shed a tear!
on the real xanax is a monotone sad as fuck cloud boy we cry
so i had to put that ritalin on my debit card which overdrafted me I HATE LIFE!
This is how you know I’m stressed out when my period was 7days late and as soon as I take some Xanax to calm myself from having an anxiety attack then it comes.
@Jude__ME I have been on Duloxetine for a month. For me, it is like I have been spiked with speed/amphetamine. But 3 hours sleep maximum per day without heavy medication, not good.
@mellyb1979 That’s what my mom said to do hhaha ( dr prescribed!!) i took my bunny out instead because you can’t drive on Xanax and i felt trapped
I think the only reason I listen to Number 1 Angel more than Pop2 is bc it reminds me of my adderall fueled summer https://t.co/z2BtF2UQhn

Today's day 2 on #Latuda. Today I noticed that there were times I couldn't sit still, was agitated about 50-75% of the day, and broke down crying for a solid 30 seconds (seriously, less than an actual minute) when I got home. Lol.
@realDonaldTrump are having patients get on suboxone! This is just as addictive! #Trump2020
i found some xanax in my bedi took that shit, went back to sleep
my brain is seriously in need of some of that ativan or xanax like sis calm down, drink some water, take a nap, leave my body the fuck alone https://t.co/8I5LSVcbRD

@PaulMayATL I canvassed in PA thru E-Day 2016, drove home, was awakened by a friend w/almost the worst news of my life. I re-upped Netflix, HBO, broke out the airplane-reserved Xanax, &amp; turned everyone away with "Can't talk yet" for 2 days.  This year will ROCK! #VOTEBLUE

Tomorrow I’ll be flying back to Arizona with my little brother to pack up my entire 4 bedroom house in 24 hours that I just sold.I will need tons of weed &amp; Adderall &amp; don’t think I’ll sleep. Thinking about streaming the entire thing once I land on the plane. Thoughts?
I don’t get my doctor not prescribing me xanax bc it’s a controlled substance when it would literally help my anxiety
Sometimes Prozac annoys me because I feel angry, I wanna be angry but it just gets hard to breath and it disturbs me just how emotionless I am
Thank fuck for my aunt giving me a Xanax, felt like I was going to explode #singleparents #werehardcore #cantstopwontstop
I’ve successfully narrowed down my prospect list for cuffing season! Finalists: * me* myself* Prozac

@brooklynsbeat Dude, take a Xanax and chill for a min. It’s literally game 1. I don’t think Rockets fans, Grizzlies fans, Heat fans are worried right now. If things aren’t looking right 5 games in then feel free to continue these rants, but right now they’re a little much
Hopefully today's problems were caused by stress and my starting Cymbalta again, on an empty stomach. Ugh.
tbh everyone needs to take half a xanax and calm tf down

#Beto is fidgety as hell. How much adderall is this dude on? #TexasTownHall
Thing that made sense, gave me control and it was a way to punish myself because I hated myself. I also developed an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and my prescription of Xanax and klonopin. In May of 2015, I tried to kill myself. Ended up in the hospital and woke up two-

@TheGiftedonFOX If you don’t learn to control yourself, you end up eating Xanax off the floor in front of your wife while haviing a meltdown. You have to pick yourself up, Reed.

You have to beat Lil pump in a Xanax eating contest first
think you poppin Xanax bars but it’s fentanyl
I feel so weird bc I’m on valium and adderall every day as well as a bunch of other meds like antidepressants and antipsychotics, YET I still feel more normal than I felt without the medication... so I guess it’s working?
Why I googled the use of Xanax lmaoooo. I never knew the real reason people were actually prescribed those pills, only know people took it to get high
Being at the laundromat on adderall is the worst. I’m just staring at my clothes spinning back and forth while I grind my teeth.
These Xanax got me outta there frfr
Fantastic. I have no therapy appointments scheduled because she never called me back and my sleep meds and my hope for Xanax wasnt addressed by my psych who dropped me because I said I wanted to be re-diagnosed.
Girl i-
I need to go take another Adderall , my eyes are about to close!
Bars = place to drink alcoholBars = rap versesBars = xanaxDon’t get it confused.
My thyroid must have been functioning at a really low level cuz after taking synthroid my body is actually processing food and stuff! Cool cool 😎

I have to replant my mirena very soon, and I'm fucking gonna lose my mind. I went in at 15 on Xanax and it was SOOO very fucking painful, I can't imagine this whole "remove and replace in one motion" nonsense. I'm already cramping thinking about it. Send vibes. My cervix hurts.

@DereckRd2 @fjxsu Sometimes you just gotta let the adderall take control
I’ve been taking Effexor (venlafaxine) since March 1st and it has basically ruined my life. I know everyone has different experiences with medication but the withdrawals and side effects are AWFUL for me, and I’ve read that others have this experience with it as well.
Anyway, I just thought this was useful info. I don’t think antidepressants are bad necessarily, this one just didn’t work for me and I thought I’d share my experience for anyone that’s been looking into taking Effexor. If I could go back in time, I probably would not take it lmao
@mjawandz11 I was on Effexor briefly last year, and I had similar experiences. It was awful.
Money’s the reason I gotta take Ritalin
Bars lol I was rolling when I heard that
The best thing about being a piece of shit is that when you’re hungry and have nothing to eat, you can just eat an adderall. Someone wife me up, promise you’ll never have to cook for me and I won’t waste our money on fast food.
This where lyrica get her beautiful ass voice from

@markberman I gotta go take my Paxil. I forgot this morning and I'm starting to feel everything is crazy again.  I know it must be me.

Man, I hopped up out this Earth and turned into a star.Baby girl, forgot you like I ate a xanax bar.
I get to up my dose of Prozac to 10mg in two days yay! Anyone have any side effects when going up a dose? How long did they last? The first time all I had was the shits for a day and then I was fine lol

The highlight of my day is going to be when I take a Xanax in 5 hours in hopes of sleeping on my flight.

@CanisFamiliariz it might not, these things affect people differently. like i've been on fluoxetine for like 2 years now and have basically no side effects other than dry mouth, but it made my best friend em so tired she had to switch meds, which is what happened to me w sertraline
Doctor told me I can't take Ritalin on an empty stomach. Did a little research, found out most people take it before meal bc food makes it less effective........ https://t.co/RP5aGHLlfh

@NewQuistShani there ain’t none of that, she “overdosed” on xanax while her kids were w her then she totaled her car and apparently has a brain bleed but is conscious. it seems like anthony and his mom have sympathy for her which is bothering me the most
does anyone else feel like their brain is overheating and buzzing when they take adderall
Worse than all else for me now is my father’s insistence that a Xanax would cure all my problems. Jeez, Dad, you’ve been pushing zombie pills on me for over 20 years and I’ve said “NO” every time.

Well, I just can't take the BS anymore. My anxiety is just topping out. Xanax is my friend, and that's as scary as what's happening to our country. Anyway, I'm gonna step back till November 7th., and hope like hell I'll be cheering for that #BlueWave .
“This rat the size of... Lyrica.” I AM DEAD. My God.
Every day I make it without refilling my Xanax prescription is a step closer to the inevitable nervous breakdown that I subconsciously crave

@CarlynZwaren @RyanMarino @JoshBloomACSH @emergVictorious Ugh. I can never take tramadol again. I was on Effexor for years when I was prescribed tramadol. Serotonin syndrome is no fun. And then it took for-freaking-ever to find a good antidepressant. Talk about depressing.
Stop yelling gang shit when all you do is eat Xanax with your loser ass friends.
@MaryNumair hi it’s me! the guy who swirls a lozenge around in my mouth clacking my molars

Only thing keeping me alive is the adderall 😑
just my opinion but xanax is fucking awful and my life would have been so much better if i had never been perscribed it and gotten hooked on it
@KellKe11 I take 150mg of trazodone at night and I’m not very fond of it because it keeps me drowsy the next morning for awhile. Hopefully my psychiatrist listens to me and gives me ambien because it worked in every way for me when I had it in the hospital bc the IV made me too scared.🙌🏻
@Toorichy2 @Victor_Abati I also watch @LlFEOFRlCKEY videos, sucks the depression right out of me. Better than any Xanax!
Kimbrel warming up. Get the xanax, klonopin, alcohol, or anxiety remedy of your choice ready. #RedSox
is there such thing as a trazodone fairy?
Only time I’ve ever thought I felt “normal” was when I was on adderall lol smh
I should have taken a xanax
@KattyKayBBC @AleemMaqbool @HardballChris They had no clue. She was acting out because she was in pain. I did manage to get a Xanax in her. The ambulance finally showed up 10 mins later. The cops were here for half hour.  All they did was make everything worse. I will never call 911 ever again.
I want that xanax feeling immediately

once I stop feeling so alone, get over erlo and this heartache I haven’t been able to let go, get some more time off of work so I have more than one day off a week to live, re-establish some kind of sleep schedule, stop pulling adderall-fueled all nighters... I’ll be kinda okay.
my dog has been full psycho the past two days, gave him a xanax which did nothing, considering taking him to emergency vet and come to find out he was scared of the pile of laundry next to my bed :-)

Not everyone is taking Adderall.https://t.co/cmcjjlvNpv
@cutielamerr Dealing for nearly 20 years. I’m sorry. It really sucks. I have emergency Xanax for the really debilitating ones. Like sobbing on the floor at Raley’s. Lol. But for the frequent ones I carry CBD oil, and repeat this to myself “I am okay, I am safe.” And count my breaths slowly.💖
This is BULLSHIT. My young cousin Abigail was addicted and arrested for heroin abuse.. my cousin fucking SUFFERING in silence and didn’t tell me anything.. I live knowing my cousin didn’t want me to know... how dare you say this shit? Shut the entire fuck up!
ambien &gt; xanax &gt; klonopin &gt; ativan &gt; benadryl &gt; zzzquil &gt; sleepy time tea &gt; melatonin
Never related to something so well.
Trying to fall asleep after taking adderall too late in the day https://t.co/MMYAmNqSfp
Unclear if I am an extremely tolerant person or the amount of Xanax I take to fly just makes me indifferent to crying babies, turbulence, and armrest hogging seat neighbors
If I tweet two times in a row or more it’s probably cus Im off the adderall ngl
a year ago today i took 120 mg of adderall and stayed up for 3 days thx snapchat flashback 🤪😩☝🏻🤩
i use to chew on them xanax to get me thru the times 😓
I'm still confused about Sicko Mode. Half a Xanax knocked Drake out for 13 hours? Ok.
@flyaway_k Me too! Thanks to that bastard, I’m now on medication for high blood pressure and anxiety. Truthfully, I’m not that anxious, but the Xanax just takes the edge off since I don’t drink.
i cant sleep should i take another trazodone
Duuuuude some people literally cannot handle Xanax. If you don’t have anxiety (your words not mine) you have NO BUSINESS TAKING IT
@WorldOfWonder @JinkxMonsoon @Sahoyah Pm me for quality Xanax https://t.co/PkLlaJLj1E
Flashback to the night my dad saw my penis after I took a Xanax
Now that I’m over my Levaquin reaction time to hit contest shape https://t.co/CyvNO29IAR

Have an itchy tongue?Yes?You suffer from Skitzo.This causes numbness.Try Prozac
BITCH I FEEL WIDE AWAKE NOW thank god for Adderall
i get so much deja vu on adderall
caffeine isn’t doing it anymore who’s got adderall
On my disability application I wouldn't have had to go through this. The two things that pissed me off were this broads assumption I was lying about being depressed bc all of a sudden she goes NO YOU ARE IT SAYS HERE YOU - I cut her off and said I take cymbalta for pain. "Oh"
Yeah you know what fuck you. The other thing I found annoying and to be fair to her she knew it was bothering me was having to explain why I had anxiety from work. Over. And over. And. Over. OH AND THEN she says BUT YOU ARE TAKING XANAX. ma'am I stopped Xanax
“Yeah I weighed 125 too when I was addicted to vyvanse.” 😂
took vyvanse... smoked.... just took more vyvanse AND drinking coffee &amp; a redbull lol RIP to me
Because you left the Xanax in your checked bag? 🤷🏻‍♀️

I miss andres man
Jonah Hill on the breakfast club off the SUPER ADDERALL bro is fucking FLYING
Ur still my gf
kinda weird but like my adderall I swear seems to function like an antidepressant in addition to helping me focus. I notice I just feel generally more at ease when I'm on it. Less of the "oh god I'm a horrible person why am I alive" that tends to come in waves organically.
I’m so numb haha
I cannot relax off a adderall fax
@zCloudFlare well fuck that🤦🏻‍♀️i guess i’ll be pickin up my adderall prescription instead😂🙉
My story of how antidepressants have dominated and ruined my life:I was 16; mildly depressed after a turbulent upbringing etc. Doctor prescribed 5mg Prozac (Fluoxetine) alongside therapy. Still feel terrible months later. I return to the doctors however my usual GP is away..
I feel like someone without ADHD who took 70mg of adderall for no reason. I'm blasted awake right now.
is it hubris to refill my xanax script in anticipation
Has anyone ever taken Seroquel and/or Propranolol? What was your experience? I'm a little nervous to start this stuff...
I’ve been joking this whole week about needing adderall for school but I literally have adhd, deadass dumb bitch mode

@SJ_Chezzy citalopram was my worst, but duloxetine was making me feel so sick they have stopped it for the past few weeks, I'm hoping sertraline helps me ;-; gross though isn't it?
@noahpeep Mmmmm delicious I have xanax cereal
And youve never taken adderall before now, right? https://t.co/xOjtwPSM5v
my butt, XANAX, the stick n poke i don't have yet
Adderall comes from magik not Anna Wisniowski . God knows there is Karma coming before it comes the whole world is set. Not listening to Anna is getting worse  . God already learned  . if you dont know how to fill out an assessment application and enter St Marys Hospital in DP
Have unwanted hair growth?Yes?You suffer from Tourettes.This causes eventual death. Try Ritalin

in treating slipped discs depending on the pain level. you have medications, physiotherapy and excruciating pain. it's likely your Orthopedist will tell you that all you can do is manage it. the side effect of Lyrica (the drug) is mad: Moodiness, dizzy spells, weight loss or gain
Our brains ain’t even awake yet. And with the way my brain works it won’t be until I pop this vyvanse .... 😴
xanax   literally zero circulation but go wild. *soul replied with an intimidating voice.*
@lisabe65 Sick the past three weeks. With my health probs I take the shot Enbrel which is an ammunosuppressant   I had an abscess on my stomach and didn’t stop the shots so they turned into MRSA that one cleared once I stopped the shot  got one on my thigh so I haven’t had shot I. 3 weeks
Have a mumbling issue?Yes?You suffer from Depression.This causes phantom limbs.Try Xanax
@lisabe65 I take that for migraines.  I take up to 800 mg of seroquil and 400 depakote for sleep.  And then when I still can’t sleep I will take a .5 Xanax.  Those little puppies kick my ass. It is so funny.  Because I take 3 30 mg roxicontin a day but the Xanax will make me stupid
@Wangleberry I've not taken sertraline but I put on about 7 kg on mirtazapine, given my weight before that had been stable within a kilo for years before that. Switching to fluoxetine has arrested the weight gain but I'm not shifting what I put on
@DrCherylBrodie @RogueSNRadvisor The rest if us are also sick from this administration.I went up 2 more mgs of my Xanax.That's 6 mgs a day.Truth that  and my dental nightmare I've even gave up my belief in Christ.  I to can't believe I live in this Counrty.I've growled &amp;begged to get my health issue finished https://t.co/GpvgnKOORZ
anyway swallowing down my ritalin with an energy drink showing im not afraid to die
I hate xanax it makes it soo easy to cry over little shit
Adderall had me like lovin everyone and shit
So I take trazodone to get decent sleep at night because for some reason, I have a backwards circadian rhythm and have for years. I forgot to take it last night so I slept like 3 hours. Now I’m awake. I can take it because I need more sleep. But I also have to be awake sooner.Ugh
i should not have taken an adderall earlier i am not out like a 💡😂😂😂
There's a group on Facebook dedicated to helping people wean off Duloxetine (or Cymbalta in the US). To do it without side effects takes 2 years, and you have to literally remove one tiny ball from the capsule at the set time. #thismorning
Sick I’m still up off this Adderall fuckin around with GT🤦🏾‍♂️
Let these meds flow 🔥🔥 #xanax #kpins #wine
we were somewhere around barstow on the edge of the desert when the xanax began to take hold
holy shit my throat has never burned this much in my whole life i cant breathe in or swallow i just had to get a throat lozenge i think i legit breathed in fire to my throat
I started a new medicine called Geodon. I was on Vraylar. I kept staring off into space. I had to snap back into reality.
Delicious!
Stop yelling gang shit when all you do is eat Xanax with your loser ass friends.
Somedays im just too tired to sleep. The anxiety to sleep overcomes the urge to sleep. I used to take Xanax for anxiety. I'm learning to cope other ways.
On a steady diet ofsoda pop and RitalinNo one ever died for my sins in hellAs far as I can tellAt least the ones I got away with

This is me waking up at 4 a.m. every day on the dot from the lingering leftover bit of my adderall prescription and then promptly going back to bed
@mancantsupply same for me but with xanax
Have migraines?Yes?You suffer from Toxic Shock Syndrome.This causes eventual death. Try Paxil

depression and vyvanse do not mix bois
I hate a “I have ADHD so adderall just makes me normal 🙄😳” face ass nigga, just tell me whether it’s $3 or $5, I’M GOOD FOR WHATEVER
Idk why people with no actual anxiety take Xanax . You only suppose to take quarter to half through out the day to balance chemical in your brain to be normal. People be abusing Xanax like candy it’s crazy.
Just started fluoxetine because I couldn’t get access to psychological therapies on the NHS. Feel absolutely rubbish. People just assume you take a pill and feel better instantly.

SHIT WAS LIT TOO
Yup. Its time to re-post this information. Many children are given the flu shot. Get the flu. Are given tamiflu. Then die. Officials Blane the flu. Push more flu shots that are only 20%... https://t.co/Xng2b96wYR
I did this to my grandmother so she’d quit smoking. She just told me to get a lozenge and hush.
Have an itchy tongue?You probably have Skitzo.This causes blood clots.Try Ritalin
I miss Xanax I used to have so much with her
Same for quetiapine. The drug that saved my life?; perhaps. Induces sleep?; very much so, from personal experience. Handle with care.
Recently got reminded how surreally good "Trazodone" by Trophy Scars is.
This week in #AnkylosingSpondylitis living: methotrexate on Wednesday led to wicked hangover yesterday that’s still going this morning. Got my flu shot, arm still sore, and seems that I’m having an injection site reaction to my Enbrel. Can’t win for trying?!
@LordCatoshi Tamiflu is working wonders though. Only 1-2 days of excruciating sickness really.

@AliceEvansGruff  I know your dilemma. At 6:34 this morning, Yeager and I finished off half a package of Nutter Butters. Couldn't sleep. Didn't take my Trazodone!
@Dustyjumpwings talk to your dr...trust me.  I started losing my hair when I was taking effexor, I had to stop it because I could notice how thin my hair was getting.  now i’m on zoloft &amp; it’s definitely better, I still lose hair but it’s not as significant

I swear I’m trying my hardest to avoid a Xanax prescription I can’t stand that shit. But I only got 2 hours of sleep last night. I’m gonna die if I keep this up.
It was just about when I mixed up my cologne with my albuterol inhaler that I realized this week needs to end...
I would take a Xanax for my back pain rn and I absolutely hate Xanax
@1UZ_FE_32 I wandered in there for grins and had to back out fast. Never have I seen that much estrogen and Prozac in one place.
@bennyjohnson He’s definitely an emotional drunk, and likely coming down off his adderall.
@jayal96 I was on it for like three months an I still felt ALL my anxiety ALL day lol I had to take like two Xanax to keep me calm but now I just need my lexapro no more Xanax 👏🏼

UGH I HATE MY GAG REFLEX i just want to take prozac 😭😭😭
“You know me, I’m doing just fine, cigarettes and adderall been keeping me alive.”

Why is this so funny
I am so fucked up on coffee and bcaa's right now. I feel like I'm on 50mgs of adderall. Woah
So I took another vyvanse before my other one wore off and it’s making me so focused that I’m legit scrubbing all the stains on my carpet with a toothbrush 🤦🏼‍♀️

adderall always makes me have to shit my life out 😷😷😷
IM GOING TO DIE
I was asked if #antidepressants makes one happy.  No, it just makes downs not as down. The first gave me constant head fog. The next, #Prozac, gave me nightmares the first nights every time I’ve used it. Then comes muting, dampening.  Helpful, not ideal. #BookMappingToUnlearn https://t.co/jgjoo0dUpm
I can’t actually get my hands on Vyvanse for another week and I am not thrilled tbh
Having @XavierDLeau on @ThisIsTheRead was everything I needed to finish out this week! When that fool said “rats as big as Lyrica” I just pulled my car over...I just couldn’t 🤣🤣🤣🤣 a blackass treasure u are
Think you poppin xanax bars
Seroquel overdose is how I wanna die
lyrica having a 4 am breakdown on her story like fucking mood
My entire childhood my parents refused to medicate me for my ADD, now I’m an adult taking adderall prescribed TWICE a day because it’s that bad. I could’ve had this shit figured out years ago.
After denying my request for Xanax my dentist informed me that she couldn’t give me more than the 5 shots of Novocain I already got that wasn’t working because my anxiety was metabolizing it too quickly. So guess who got pumped with Novocaine, rescheduled and upgraded to Valium!!
nobody tell julissa i came across this
Lyrica is so extra I stan
Got a Bernie's taxes!Xanax!
Last two laps, was starting to weave and stagger.  might have been tired, might be Pregabalin kicking in.Last lap, pushed out of comfort zone.  Just a little further, just a little longer with home not in line of sight.
@corybellFGC lol i remember this one time my brother took adderall for the first time, played COD so much he temporarily got arthritis in his finger
I would’ve believed him if he said he was on Adderall. Now that my friend sounds like something Juice World would be on

I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day for my "back pain," Adderall to stay focused, Xanax to take the edge off, pot to mellow me out, cocaine to wake me back up again, and morphine, well, because it's awesome #bestquote 😂
@bluekeyblade “Rats as big as lyrica” + crissle losing it took me out!!!!
No doubt $YNDX bulls are taking Xanax. The selling has been brutal.

Bitch I’m off 12 xanax
pregabalin is a fucking MIRACLE DRUG
Seriously don’t even talk to me in the mornings until I’ve had my Prozac
Jokes aside, my doctor asked me if I wanted Xanax to help with my sleep or not, but warned me about it’s serious threat of leading to permanent addiction.
Adderall got me listening to what you’re saying
doctors be saying Vyvanse is going help my ADD but all it does is make me want to starve myself out and get dizzy with it
Think you popping Xanax bars but it’s Fentanyl, think you living life like rockstars but you dead now......
I think almost every college student has had a full semester where they were addicted to Xanax
Where does it tell me this on the label?
Adderall makes me talk to people I don’t even want to talk to someone tell me to shut up
Ugh. I am stressed. I'm pretty sure I need xanax or something.
Lyrica was really going through it https://t.co/q4rk7URYis
Giving out Ritalin Xanax kpins et al to high school kids with no safegaurds was a great idea.
@A_SADPIKACHU i believe honesty will get u that xanax along with God moving ur doctors heart somhe prescribes it to u. i loved xanax so much. God was good to me even before i knew Him
this girl overdosed on ADDERALL?? she must have had the heart of an 85 year old

Listen, my prozac already has the side effect of making me shaky for absolutely no reason but I literally have to take a study break rn because I'm on my 4th espresso shot and my hands are shaking too much to highlight in a straight line, my life is a modern Shakespearean tragedy
The adderall is kicking in time to fuck up this final.
wish i had a pound of xanax
@kharypayton When I got all 4 of mine pulled, the dentist also gave me 5 Xanax and said take as many as I want. I have no memory of it and had very little pain.
I hate it when I don't realise I'm on the last square of chocolate. I'm so upset I just ate it like a regular piece instead of sucking it like a throat lozenge.
Realizing I’m only emotional because I’m PMSing and I took adderall a couple days ago
@NotYourYogurt i was addicted to adderall
My cars panic alarm went off today...Without warning. And so I filled the tank up with 23 gallons of Xanax. Then it stopped. Thankfully. 🙏😂
Effexor withdrawal is a bitch and I didn't even take very much for very long.
@Riclusive i feel like a furnace and vyvanse would get me out of bed in the morning and with my two 30mg Adderall IRs still there it was a much better combination

@SONNYYVAL You won’t die without your Xanax sir, trust me
Arabs down advil like its Xanax thinking its gonna relieve all their stress and worries
I felt so bad I thought I needed sleep but after drinking wine, eating, taking a xanax, watching Dave Chappelle (again), drinking bourbon, taking more pills, laying down, watching Harry Potter, eating again, oh and let's say 6 vodkas...I feel normal again! Progress.
Benzos like Xanax, Kolonopin &amp; Ambien quickly alter the brains receptors. This CAUSES anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, heart problems and many other serious health issues.Never take a benzo for more than two weeks, EVER!Always taper slowly.Help?https://t.co/0hYKSohO9N
the most memorable thing about my xanax phase was when these opps got on top of me cuffing me up n i was jus screaming at them
The lyrica might be working? Maybe? I’ve felt a very slight relief. I made homemade pizza! The dough I made on Tuesday night and it had been proofing in the fridge since then! Very flavorful crust. ❤️ https://t.co/FhYorfEt15
shower time, adderall, a glass whiskey and diesel jeans
Premier league withdrawal worst than Xanax.
Imagine if you got named Lyrica😂
@JoeSantagato Xanax is my best friend
#Tamiflu is not safe OR effective – https://t.co/6kcWGfnVPd https://t.co/akaeygzTwh #flu
my doctor told me to stop he gave me something to pop i mix it up with some adderall and i wait to get to the top
@silencekink seroquel and xanax got me thru some shit
this was funny
Crackhead once again
My psycho ass took a vyvanse an hour ago so here we go
money’s the reason I gotta take Ritalin
@Paola_Dec1231 Prozac meltdown
So far, the Humira has already helped a bit. My joints are all moving fluidly, but there's still lingering pain from head to toe.It's the weekend now, so I'm going to be medding up.Any big plans for you guys this weekend?
Disappointed in the Sicko Mode video because doing half of a Xanax (only half) on an airplane was like THE most relatable Drake lyric I've ever heard and I took it way too literally
💘💘 even tho we don’t interact much ily bitch u always answering my questions when I ask ur tweets about the Xanax also cracked me up 😭
New One-Dose Flu Drug Shows Promise: The study also found it as effective as the current standard drug, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), at controlling symptoms such as coughing, sore throat, headache, fever, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue. https://t.co/pQTUqLXmhU https://t.co/dXDuguosBm
I’m screaming Bitch that was SO HUMILIATING
Think you poppin' Xanax bars, but it's Fentanyl(No-no bars, it's Fentanyl)Think you're living life like rockstars but you're dead now (Yeah)
when i take too much adderall i feel like a sleepy passenger in my own head while my body is on autopilot
@BuzzFeedNews I had the "real flu" the year the shot didn't cover enough of the strains; had 103.5 fever; my MD prescribed Tamiflu which brought the fever down to normal in a day, and also Zithropak to prevent pneumonia.  But the enervation lasted 3 weeks. Always get the shot.
@barrydsmith1966 @heatherzamm @Iamchronicpain @ravensspirit68 @process_x @Jmkilingnyc @JMA8213 @louisec385811 @StarvinLarry @RobertDRoseJr1 @DanLairdMD @ThomasKlineMD @DaveH_RPh @Pharmaciststeve Is properly treating me thank god but my body &amp; wallet r shot. I’m having 2 take meds 2 undo the damage other meds have done. It’s so true the good old opioids r the safest way to go. They don’t harm your thyroid or Seratonin. I was already depressed but the Lyrica messed me up.
hello swiffers has anyone ever taken adderall for studying purposes
i refuse to drink coffee, i use ritalin instead
Xanax made  me forget about your ass
I wonder how many days of random crying outburst and constant panic it will take for me to finally not be lazy enough to go get my Prozac out of the mailbox
This has been a really rough 3 weeks and I’m proud of myself for not refilling my Xanax prescription. I know it would help but I don’t trust myself to not get messy again. I totally understand why people drink and it makes me sad.
Chick pulls up to drive thru with a broken window and her fuck boy riding shotgun rolling a joint: “hi I’m here to pick up my Norco and Xanax”
Got off the trazodone that shit was giving me nightmares
@Mikeggibbs Psst. If the flu vax really worked, people would never get the flu. Better to keep Tamiflu on hand in case you get it. Make sure you have ALL your other vaccinations though, and get your boosters when it’s time.
calm my bad nerves i call her my ritalin
Sleep at night and get off Xanax and booze!
Got some Xanax prescribed to me today thank god it better knock me out

@batnammy I stopped taking fucking prozac
And now here I am snorting Adderall (which I hate and never do) because I was too awk to say no (which is not like me cuz I passionately hate addy)
Apparently I look like I do Xanax
My doctor was telling me that lucid dreams are a side effect I might get when I increase my meds and I had to tell her that’s my favorite thing about taking Prozac

Lmao this is me
I took lamictal till I was 16
@HexManiacWingy That was my experience. I have narcolepsy, so I could take an adderall/vyvanse and take a nap. Sometimes it made me hyper, depending on caffeine intake and narcolepsy symptoms. Weird meds.
That’s why I stay away from a lot of drugs and stimulates cause I swear it hits me hard af😂
Why is my xanax speaking spanish? https://t.co/OI0xbTx5Cr

@KurumiT0k1saki well i take trazodone and it can be strong so i might sleep in super late like i did that one day i need sleep but cant sleep without it really because i get night terrors and they lead to panic attacks*

ladies this is why we don’t take too much adderall. It makes me clench my jaw and let me tell u my jaw doesn’t get sore easily.. but it’s sore today ://:
I don’t wanna get burnt after death. I wish to be sent away with my stupid Kermit the frog toy holding in my hand and Xanax on my eyes. During the funeral I want there to be lil peep music playing all along. And I want a huge sign next to my coffin says “EVERYBODY IS GUILTY “
Those people just won’t give me Xanax fucking hell I’m in pain

at least i discovered that 100mg of lamictal is probably the closest I can get to a therapeutic dose. i started feeling significantly worse when i cut it for a few days
LOL I love having PTSD and my parents ramping up the household stress days before my birthday. Can’t wait to celebrate being 18 by being dosed up with Xanax and every other medication I have
@iwiIIstayaIive uhh I fucked with adderall
@nateroyaI i'm on pexil, so it stays in my blood stream and doesn't wear off like if you just took xanax, so i'm essentially on medication every time i drink and yet... gasp! never abused anyone!
Can the US like not pull out of,the INF? Cause I've gone my whole life without a nuclear war scare and,I'd like to keep that streak up. I don't have enough Xanax to get through close calls with the apocalypse.
@DebiDawson8 I took cymbalta for pain. It numbs me to much emotionally. So they stopped it. Thank you. I will definitely reach out.
@beccacanote Imma stick with my Effexor for now.
friday night: downing half a xanax with malbec and applying a warm compress to the ganglion cyst on my wrist
@thaniagxrl I took a Xanax earlier for my panic attack and everything is so funny
My pharmacist won’t tell me the dose for when you take enough Xanax to keep from waking up with your teeth ground to the gum line, but not so much Xanax that you don’t wake up at all. I’m just gonna eyeball it.
I have the worst anxiety about going to bed today bc i dont want to be disappointed if Xanax doesn’t knock me out like it used to

@Mare_Bear_Baum @UtePadre Ha!! Me neither. I clean when I get nervous. But tonight I learned that I am too tired to clean. The house is still a mess. Xanax might be the answer. 😂😂

@AdvocateAr I had friends on Lyrica who both gained weight but not that much. Abilify also caused another friend to gain weight. I was on Baclofen and it made me nauseous every time I tried to get up. People react differently to all of them it seems.
@Mr_Monkey_UK I am staying on 112.5mg of Venlafaxine for the time being because this tapering has mentally and physically drained me.
This is how tired I am. I took an Adderall and managed a full night’s sleep three hours after I took it. And that was after taking a small caffeine pill just before bed to ward off a headache.

vyvanse makes me pee out everything i drink p much immediately, and thus get dehydrated rly easily. i took it before work today. finding a balance between "not dehydrated" and "not peeing like twice an hour every hour" is gonna be a time

I feel like I took a Xanax but I didn’t

i’m wet, i’m hungry, i want a drink, where’s the xanax
@wowyouaredumb1 Stay strong! I take 10mg of xanax everytime Drumpf tweets, so I don't break my furniture anymore. I level it up to 15mg if he's doing a rally.

I had h1n1 when it was running rampant.  I honestly thought I was going to die.  I was able to get tamiflu right away and it helped but I was still off work 3 weeks and picked up every bug after that.  Since then I have had the flu shot.  Why take the chance?
@sick__66 There's no way it makes you hornier than Adderall makes me 😁
anyone else have wild ass dreams on lamotrigine 😬
anyone else have wild ass dreams on lamotrigine 🙃
Just over 3 years after starting running, I was fortunate enough to test my limits and push myself for 96 hours and roughly 240 miles. Just a few years ago, at age 30, I couldn’t run a single mile and was going to be put on Lipitor for high blood pressure. You can change.... https://t.co/ER8EzqR925
COMET trial demonstrated benefit of carvedilol over metoprolol for heart failure. Digoxin helps people feel better and out of the hospital so greatly underutilized in appropriate systolic heart failure patients. #chf
I’m in the emergency room rn and some kid came in cause he blew his nose and blood came out. The doctor is prescribing him Xanax. Like really? Is it that easy!? Shits crazy. Scary to know how easy it is to get addictive prescriptions.

@kitkat68960786 @TM_MadHatter 1st time I got a stone was like 10-15 mins after I took an adderall pill I honestly thought I had overdosed somehow because my mind scream "The kidneys go first" worst pain ever.

Adderall makes me play Infinite Warfare (Zombies)
never in my life have i realized i needed a xanax prescription as much as when I’m in the car with my dad
Both medications reduced pain minimally (gabapentin-7.54 to 5.82 &amp; Lyrica 7.33 to 6.38(scale of 0-10 with 10 being the highest level of pain possible) 67% reported adverse events including drowsiness, dizziness or nausea. A study of 18 patients with 67% reporting Adverse Events?
@_tbitech It does for some people. You have to be much more aggressive about sleep hygiene than normal people tho. I have blackout curtains, a @MantaSleep mask, &amp; trazodone.

Things were getting better and better, and after a year and a half, I barely struggle with depression, although my anxiety is still a problem, my OCD and ADD have been the biggest struggles in my life. My psychiatrist started giving me Adderall.
3 cups later ive resorted to checking my blood pressure to make sure i'm not dying (i'm good)
god scammed me for adderall behind an aspen dental
Vyvanse? 💊
@DougCoupland @cymbalta Any way back? ❤️
I couldnt see my doctor at mental health the other day...booked up...but i did see the head nurse...Asked to change my meds but after i gave my reasons why, she said i sounded depressed...and put me on Prozac instead! 😒I do feel better tho...
adderall has me fucked up not in a bad way but in a "wtf im so used to having 5000000 things clouding my brain screaming constantly but now i actually feel more focused and tho im still a bit scatterbrained its not nearly as bad" way
only time i have given a fuck about you was off molly AND xanax. dude trying to coast me into being gay fuck you.
@JuiceWorlddd How does one make 200 songs about Xanax and a broken heart
@RachelODonnell6 @BoldlyTweeting They put me on metoprolol(sp?)&amp; I have Bentyl for muscle relaxer for  SOD. I was on Nortriptyline for it but my heart started racing..I’m wondering if this could be from that..I stopped 2 nights ago, but it takes awhile for symptoms to leave a body. Just weird. Only when I stand
@BreezyxSupreme Exactly I was on anxiety/mood stabilization pills (seroquel xr) and it fucked my whole life up I'm actually about to start using cbd today

1 hour in a house with 3 cats, and I’m now sitting in my car inhaling albuterol and fresh air while my allergy eye drops soak in 🤧
Adderall is overrated when girls call you that now its call me 'Carrot Top cause my hair clearly dyed black.
Latuda was like a sedative and I felt like my scalp was on fire and lamictdal was...I never really gave it a chance.
Midol and Xanax. Just what the doctor ordered.
Anyone know where my bottle of nexium is
@pupperony @lunarspeIIs With practice? And... therapy. I recently discovered adderall 100% made it worse too. I’ve developed a lot of Good Habits recently to control myself because like, I would honestly lose sleep/go manic when being invested in things.
Headache all day... Xanax time 😴😴😴
Adderall the greatest thing man has created
Okngoodnight, I fucked up my sleeping pattern and I wasted another day of my pointless and worthless life, quetiapine will now take me to the land of a heavy 8 hour long dreamless coma
That adderall had me sweating on a 30 degree day
i just popped the whole bottle of xanax before walking into this haunted house
@computer_screen @couchdefiler2 I lost 2 adderall btw
@mkheck Xanax is your friend. It's not healthy to be 24hrs wo sleep.

@lavlittle I actually lowkey understand. Like I couldn’t tell my dreams from reality on Zoloft and I can’t now on Ziprasidone
@hmkerstetter Thank you. I'm skipping saline/albuterol and going straight to Pulmicort so I'm hoping to avoid the "drowning in my own lungs" thing this time around.

@hightopfaded_ NAH BRO DOWNTOWN XANAX AND HENNESSY DONT MIX I JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD
@kablamoko You’re not alone, sometimes I need to take a Xanax just to go grocery shopping. I’m a loner, but far from being lonely. I enjoy my life of solitude.
OFF XANAX AND WEED UNTIL IM SO HIGH I CANT FUCKING SEE THIS IS THE WORST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME AND IM NOT KIDDING IM SO FUCKING IM LOSING MY MIND RIGHT NOW MY DOG IS LIKE THE ONLY REASON I HAVE TO LIVE SHES LITERALLY THE ONLY THING THAT HELPED ME WITH RECOVERING
there is really, truly nothing more grating than someone 'splaining to you why the term "crazy" is acceptable while your excedrin has ceased to be effective and your withdrawal headache from poorly timed effexor doses is kicking in again
I fill my emptiness with paroxetine.
@godesosa I have BPD, not bipolar, but I've been on Seroquel since May and taken 50mg since August. I also took Resperdal when I was a teenager. I've noticed that it's lessened my negatives, but I haven't seen a lot of positives. Seroquel's made me gain 50lbs in six months.
@envy_muah Gotta stop drinking then blunts then get real busy like school and or full time work...only way I’ve ever got close...I didn’t stop but I was doing it more from habit then necessity at one point...figured out I got anxiety and I’d rather do it than Xanax nowadays
Gabapentin and pregabalin are often used for neuropathic pain https://t.co/xEJch52Zxy
Poppped a 10 mg zyprexa and left work early and slept all afternoon... i needed that... shout out to my manager that let me out early and being understanding
she never called back. I had a full blown breakdown the Monday before finals in my last semester. I wound up in the crisis center of my college with a case worker who called my LCSW. Finally she called at almost 5pm and said to take my adderall again. I crammed 16 weeks
puking all day. puked up three different xanax bars. i bet the pharmacy wont let me pick up a day early because they're little cunts lol
tryin 2 act like taking prozac for the first time in a year will automatically fix me
Adderall is the greatest thing invented in human history

7 yrs ago today, my good bud @acon22 found my naked lifeless body in a pile of piss, dehydrated fruit and tree nuts on our tile dorm room floor. Everyday I‘m thankful for him and albuterol for saving my life! Thanks guy for doing that even if it looked weird.
No clue why I have a bottle full of Zantac. Damn near got excited and thought they were Adderall
Taking a Xanax in hopes that I will be able to sleep past 8am tomorrow
sometimes I wonder if I just feel like I have dampened "normal" emotions just because my medication makes me like that. I cant really remember what it was like not being on paxil
Glad you’re still here to look at shitty memes with me. Love you man.
but since paxil is basically a sedative to me it would make sense that it dampens all my other emotions too
about to take like 500mg seroquel and call it a day hope i sleep for 20 hours
Sooooo your feet will swell up and you might go blind but your feet will stop tingling.  Gee thanks #Lyrica #livepd  #LivePDNation

Mile 2780: Horrible night. Had a seizure after not eating for 3 days (low blood sugar +  prescription of Ritalin + Bupropion) followed by 'minor' Tachycardia. Passed out for 6 hours. Woke up with sweat frozen on the skin. Exhausted beyond measure. Made it to Death valley #irony
My brain on adderall
@hannahtraining I don’t do downers anymore bc my baseline existence is tired and apathetic. The only thing I really truly abuse is caffeine but I have enough prescribed adderall in my system at any given time that I’m sure I’d have a heart attack if I took coke lmao
Also1- I’m still stressed 2- wtf 3- I just took xanax 4- I’m leaving this city tomorrow god

@scrubsntopknot Concerta made me feel frickin weird . I've been on different stimulants since grade school and I couldn't handle concerta . I'm on Vyvanse and I've had the best luck with it
@dontbeVtachy My psych actually wanted to put me on Vyvanse but since I was one concerta before, he just left me with it starting at 18 and then bumped it to 36. I don’t know what to do. Sometimes I feel it helps, other time I don’t. Maybe I need to stop drinking coffee with it
@_mystic_toddlr_ @chesterlockhart I didn't know there was alcohol in Adam's lemonade cuz I couldn't taste it and the Xanax gave me dry mouth so I chugged his drink and yeah😳
Might drink the 5th off the Xanax
@scrubsntopknot I feel that with Vyvanse some days I get all the things done, sometimes Im just starin at wall for 10 minutes zoned out. I think it's a human thing meds won't do it all . I tried straterra last semester and it was a shit show. I know how you feel you want it to work but it's too
@KevinBarr66 Im trying to avoid xanax like the plague so broke down and stopped by lol.
@astralprjecticn How do I get more iron?👀 Like I eat and drink water but I just got off prozac so idk like I get dizzy/ light headed a lot

I got over a really tough breakup that I thought was going to be the end of me, I worked through my depression and anxiety (you the real MVP, Cymbalta!), I’ve gotten more productive, I traveled somewhere alone for the first time, I let go of my grudges, &amp; I friggin’ joined a gym!
@westprocrastina @lkoturner Yes, that too. I immediately stopped taking Paxil as soon as I found out I was pregnant but then just spent the entire time torturing myself with how my anxiety and depression was going to harm my baby’s developing brain. WE CANT WIN.
sometimes i take my xanax with wine but at least i still wear my retainers https://t.co/CeJhePwvUs

i should really refill my lamictal prescription huh
@contrarianbias @johannhari101 I tried Lexapro and Effexor before finding Wellbutrin, and my experiences with both were very negative. I got little relief, despite feeling emotionally anesthetized, and had severe side effects (40lb/1mo weight gain/something akin to seizures, respectively).
my cats name is Xanadu.I call her:XanyXanaxStupid 🤪
This Prozac is definitely making me feel like deathhhhh
I Got No Job I Got No Money Got No Self Esteem, I Take A Xanax Every Morning For Anxiety
Thank you Xanax for knocking that bout down. Think I know what to talk to the doctor about. Lorazepam daily, then trail it off, just like last time. Just gotta keep myself keyed down and not overstimulated.

@retiredcalvin I had to take 2 Xanax last time my falafel was cold in the middle to stop myself from freaking the F out
@emeraldleighw bupropion. literally had to google wtf that was and wasn't aware i smoked til nOW LOLused to be on prozac
@Umbrony Ahhhh yeah.. I'll have to Google that too hahaha I was on Prozac for a but plateaued quickly. Lexapro, despite making me gain weight, has been much more consistent for me brain.
I can never tell if my Seroquel makes me hungry or if I'm timing my meals poorly. Either way the result is me eating in bed a lot.
on the bright side, i haven't cried about the loss on account of i can't cuz of prozac. like, i can't. i want to but i can't. WHY WON'T MY EYES GET WET
I can’t wait til I eventually get a Xanax prescription and never be forced to feel anything again. I would rather my anus tear from a violent shit than for me to feel emotion towards another human being. The night terrors May never stop
Rough night. Patiently waiting for my Xanax to kick in so I can sleep. 😴

Witnessing my boyfriend in front of his college friends:1. Hide daggers behind his smile in the face of snakes in high grass2. Chug four delirium tremens 3. Steal half an adderall to be taken later
Just had the Xanax induced thought that recess was just teachers getting their mandatory work breaks
@lkoturner I was really sad I had HG bc it meant I couldn’t self-report to the makers of Lamictal that my baby was born healthy after I took it the entire pregnancy. It’s the only way to get that kind of info in the medical literature! But your pregnancy has to be perfect to count :(
that great lady killing dumbass polak czerbo lost to cancer on my twenty first birthday. I went to the boats &amp; gambled alone for 36 hrs straight on Xanax &amp; weed &amp; free whiskey sours all night &amp; day while czerbo took his last breath. He wanted me there &amp; I was too chicken shit to

Have you eaten today?You probably have Pica.This causes eventual death. Try Ritalin
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep.
took an adderall but now i’m focused on the pain
i got so stressed that I took a nap and got knocked out for 12 hours and then woke up to find that my period broke, basically my weekend has been wasted crying, doing adult stuff, xanax and ibuprofen
Have a mumbling issue?You probably have Autism.This causes eye hemorrhagingTry Prozac
@tstallone TY Teresa! PsA feels so unknown and people usually expect to see skin issues. BC I take Enbrel and it cures my skin psoriasis, I have nothing that people can “see” so they don’t believe that anything is wrong.  So damn frustrating!  Today I have 7/10 pain but it’s “hidden”...
I should’ve live streamed me watching season 2 of making a murderer cross faded on Xanax and weed
For someone that was addicted to adderall in high school I am not handling my caffeine tonight
Every bone in my body hurts!  We danced to all the 98 jams all night!   My 20th high school reunion owes me nothing....but some Boniva!!! Ha!
@tyleroakley @beautifuIshoes Wow the sound of that intro is like an instant Xanax I am so at peace. I had forgotten how those videos saved my life back in the day. Man oh man
You a real one

“Xanax still on my mental, been a few years since I quit em, I don’t wanna relapse but I may relapse cause I miss the feeling, the Percs been cool but I’m starting to get sick of em..”
y'all i've been off vyvanse for 3 weeks and i can't do shit and i feel really really bad about it and everything sucks okay good night
Adderall and the percys the only thing that keep me focused
Top drawer mental health meds joke here.  😁👍
@NikeAirAaron nooooo I’ve been taking vyvanse for a week and a half and I think that shit like coming back.... like the worst of it the second thing just happened. But I’m not sure cause I’ve been on adderall until like Thursday and worse than normal until kinda
@nikeairaaron nooooooooo ) : I just want to be skinny Unlike all my fam and have energy like normal ppl.  I just want vyvanse to be okay for now atleast until I lose weight and then control what I eat 5 my 1 Meal a day later bye
@UnreadDatum @Court_Moran Oh, I'm bad for that too. It's cooling off here, esp at night, but it's still a bit too humid to make a night of it. Late restless nights are when I love to prepare &amp; bake bread. Problem is my Lyrica meds have started making me hungry so I tend to eat in the kitchen too.🙁
@BipolarTweets I didn't like the side effects of Venlafaxine, they made me feel numb. I think my dose was too high.
Should I snort my Vyvanse?
Woke up with heartburn and then anthony had a nightmare and was thrashing around in bed so now im awake for good whats up yall good morning lets get this nexium
Females do shit like this and got nerve to say "omg I crack myself up, I hope I get a man who can tolerate my goofiness🤪" like no, you grown. You need some fuckin Vyvanse &amp; to stop actin like that
This Seroquel supposed to make me sleep. But instead it makes me eat.. constantly
Soon as I get off the Prozac mfs tryna put me right back on the shit and I refuse. Not over no raggedy bitches.
Noses take time off my roomates MESS or second adderall
I’ve had 20mg olanzapine and 2mg loraz.Please let sleep happen
@7NewsBrisbane I got repeats made up of Lyrica today after getting persistent neuropathic pain, essential tremors and anxiety from moving house soon, and have had 100mg, one each of 25mg and 75mg strengths.  Lyrica works very well taken together with Buprenorphine (Temgesic).
@fawkyu4 @MortimerJames1 i was blacked out? he gave me a xanax
@Boogie2988 how many anti depressants have you been on... i bet he'll just up your dose.speaking from experience. me, i just gave up and stuck with fvcking paxil bc going from one drug to another is honestly so exhausting.
Ion like Xanax anymore though, nor Lean.......That shit is pretty dead to me officially.

@iStalkPhatGirls Oh fuck yeah. Happened to me a bunch back in 2007-2010 when I had 5 jobs and was popping Adderall like breath mints.
@RainbowFoxyArt yeah, i was scared and didn’t start taking mood stabilizers until i was 20 bc i was forced into it during (semi)involuntary hospitalization 🙃then started taking adderall and some assorted anxiety meds about a year later! and that combo has honestly saved my everything
@yungboilover Xanax point of vieww
I fill my emptiness with fluoxetine.
@ShayneEdson I had antidepressants (Trazodone) and my experience was so horrible that if I now had to choose between antidepressants or death, my choice would be death. 💊👎☠️👍
why was Jonathan given 11 injections of the drug. Why did he have bruises on his head, legs and arms when he was admitted to Lister Hospital? Why were there fluid charts missing ? Why were samples from his body left to deteriorate before anyone had analysed them? #HumanRights
mental health twitter !!! does anyone have any info/advice about coming off duloxetine without going to the doctor?
It take me long af to get into a deep sleep i was falling asleep at 12:34 and wasn’t even deep asleep at 1:03 cuz i woke back up this shit crazy crazy im finna start taking adderall again😂😭🆗
Ever since I’ve been on Xanax my whole life of emotions are completely different 💔 #WRLDONDRUGS 💭
@spacereprobate https://t.co/73l5AUJwd3 Eliza is the De facto expert in my mind
The old lady in me is like damn these kids trippin off this lean shit and Xanax. Then I got thinking we used to do the same shit dumb shit IN CLASS. Awful.
honestly though I did a lot of confidential emotional labor today on the heels of untangling confidential emotional labor yesterday, plus I had an effexor withdrawal headache, and the emotional labor dealt with realizing I was possibly being manipulated

Drake had his most human moment when he talked about taking xanax to sleep his 13 hour flight on sicko mode.

@BigStrongFast 120 Percs, 90 Lyrica and 30 muscle relaxers, still I was in pain, now with Kratom pain free but ran into hardships so I have no Kratom now and I didn't withdrawal, Im just feeling except m every once in pain. Ibuprofen doesn't even scratch my pain. Do what it takes, keep it legal
American students get addicted to Adderall, British students get addicted to coffee
@Corrina35038731 i got off the amitripaline and felt better. even better was coming of the lyrica. my brain cells are becoming my own again. pain levels havent changed but i can actually cope better
.@SickNotWeak Please RT this, I really need help. I have really bad anxiety and it's been worse since the weather change. I have a fear of thunder and I wondered what I could do about it. Will Xanax help me sleep through it? Should I buy earplugs? The weather is all I think about
them dumm lmao wtf
i wished u loved me like u did xanax
havent pulled an all nighter since college and back then i would just do it bc all the hot boys looked dead in the lib ... and i also got so much online shopping done on adderall
I was Dx with hypothyroidism in my late 20’s. Given Synthroid (made me sicker/didn’t work). Did my own research. Doctor was annoyed at me😂. Happily walked off with a Rx of Armour Thyroid. The laugh was in her. Watch “Sick to Death! 8min Trailer” on #Vimeo https://t.co/o4rEX5d9MB
@TobiBennington Hello, Tobi. Could you please RT this and help me out? I have really bad anxiety and it's been worse since the weather change. I have a fear of thunder and I was wondering what I could do. Will Xanax help me sleep through it? Should I buy earplugs? I'm terrified
@ThomasKlineMD Mainly pain meds but Xanax (Alprazolam) helps with my muscle spasms which cause a large amount of my pain. As well as allowing me proper amount of sleep which also helps significantly w/pain. It also controls my severe tachycardia &amp; anxiety attacks from PTSD. But no Xanax now😒
haha my dog  autistic  getting fucking annihilated off the xanax IM LITERALLY SHAKING
King Xanax
Have you eaten today?You probably have Pica.This causes infertility.Try Adderall
I ain’t been to sleep like I’m off Adderall 🙄
@Treyarch this is going to be my last tweet. This poorly tested, dogshit game needs to be sorted. I’ve had more fun stubbing my toe on the sofa this game is that bad. The shotgun makes me want to pop a Prozac . Dogshit game sort it out you fucking retarded manchild’s. Good BYE
sleeping pattern so fucked at this point xanax is the only answer
@AidenWolfe I took 60 xanax and flatlined. A paramedic brought me back and was honored for saving me. I Woke Up 3 days later in the ICU. And a year before that I slit my wrists. That was 10 years ago and I'm a lot better now. I was only thinking about myself.
im not actually sure why rappers brag about taking Xanaxyou take anti-anxiety pills? bitch me too you aint special
Have you eaten today?Yes?You suffer from Munchausen by Proxy.This causes bellybutton growth.Try Prozac
So... where’s my adderall?
Have an itchy tongue?You probably have Avoidant Personality Disorder.This causes complete blindness.Try Paxil
On that Ritalin again making bread. Feel free to dm me and keep me companyyyy

Honestly I hate talking to people on Xanax because I have to repeat myself all the fucking time
shower time, adderall, a glass of whiskey......and diesel jeans
I have had such bad experiences with photographers lately, I feel like I need a Xanax to work with anyone but Tim and Evita 🙃😐
Think u poppin Xanax, but it’s fentanyl
Sooo I just need my Prozac and the sailor moon dvds and I’m set
i’m so fuckin dead I need a xanax and a fat burger and a sleep
forgot how you get a "feel like i could kill god" type vibe when you first start taking adderall again
@imcorinnemec Same here. Went to sleep at 2 and up at 5. There’s not enough weed or Xanax to put me back to sleep.
Never will take this crap 💩
@lt_2190 @MHCurious I hope you are doing better at the moment ! (I got severe prob w withdrawal too fr Venlafaxine.Would have never thought - there's no informing really of such/this severe problems. At least what I have seen.)
Have a habit of stealing?Yes?You suffer from Autism.This causes bones to dissolve.Try Ritalin
Thoughts on Tamiflu (before we get there): Don’t get any. It doesn’t help, it actually makes most flu cases significantly worse.
I feel happy today. 🤗....*It's not me. It's Paxil.*"I feel like dying here and now."😩...It's NOT Paxil. It's me.*
2 years clean from Xanax. Thankful to be alive

A Teenager Goes To The Doctor With Depression Or Anger Problems And They'll Tell You To Take So Much Xanax It Rots Your Brain But Gender Dysphoria Woah Woah Woah Lets Not Go Crazy Here
I used to say “it’s okay I just popped a xanny” to my friends when they knew I was about to have a panic attack. I see now that saying that is probs not best... even if I really am prescribed Xanax. I realize it is another way to say you’re getting lit... which I promise I am not
@ericsslater I am fine, having the same panic attack as the Sunday two weeks before 9/11. Took a xanax to calm down.
guccinax my at been off the xanax

One annoying thing about taking Adderall is the part when you first wake up and can't breathe.
I have this really fucking bad habit of silencing my alarm to take my effexor and then taking it like 15-20 minutes late everyday. Why am I like this.
@CelestialSandra I'm currently in the same situation. I was put on Zoloft (took it twice) and scared the eff out of me. Stopped taking it. Started having panic attacks, the ER prescribed me Xanax. It made my life a living hell for the 5 days I took it. Then another 2 and a half weeks to feel...
@Linktheinformer But that's me strictly. xanax, ativan, and haldol namely make me hallucinate when the med goes into half life form.
I thought that my fast heartbeat was proof that i took my adderall but then i remembered that's also something that happens with my anxiety, which i get when i can't remember if i took my adderall. 🎉yikes🎉
@pamcho3 @Rindie62 @AidenWolfe Ouff. I had no insurance &amp; found out when I was forced to go due to swollen feet after getting a 2 month intravenous antibiotic drip with Levaquin for an infection in my big toe that went into the bone..The stabbing/burning pain has been there since
Back then I’m goin’ crazy with the homie. Posted in the club crashing Xanax I don’t know where I be this is crazy.

In a comparison to pregabalin, gabapentin may be superior for treating chronic sciatica #pain. However, at least one expert thinks that’s not the whole story. https://t.co/6R4I3v0UZ6

adderall induced anxiety attacks :)
Take care of Sweety Geek. That chemo is hell. I spent 2  yrs on it. And just the dread of it gave me bad anxiety attacks. Thank God my Oncoligest started me on Xanax. But he retired bc he saw what Oboycare was gonna bring. My new doc refused me Xanax. Now it's hell 24/7 😞🐾🐾
Smh. Haven’t had to pop a Xanax in a minute but my hearts going to explode.
i def remember it being the most painful because my friend was with me (but i was on xanax so 1.) the pain was probably less and 2.) i dont remember much of it) but i had to keep holding her hand bc it hurt a lot lol and i kept making faces too like grimacing and whatnot
today is day 4 without prozac https://t.co/xavWTJ79Um
I did 7 wks in the hosp w/ round the clock IV antibiotics, 4 wks catheter. Later, staph inf in my heel, had heel bone shaved twice. Dislocated my ankle, walked on it a wk b4 I realized it wasn't sprained (due to numbness) had surgery, heavy fixator w/ 14 pins, 4 mo in conv hosp.
Took me a while to agree to add #Seroquel to my meds regimen. Something about the word #antipsychotic didn’t sit comfortably, afterall..... I’m not a #psychotic, am I? Ultimately, Seroquel gets the job done and as for the class of drug...Whatever #bipolar 💊💊💊 https://t.co/XtGpEoxv4V
some affordable therapy would be nice so I’m not buying xanax off the street to cope but to my “friends”, that’s just me being an addict. wish y’all knew that it only makes my depression worse when you roll your eyes.
@chestnuthell @__fc Is it too early for a Xanax because I have extreme alarm right now.
Feeling a little better today!! ☺️ We are having a few hiccups with her breathing, she’s having some asthma issues and maybe some trachea swelling. They are treating her with albuterol and it seems to be helping. She’s feeling much better, though! https://t.co/BxJzdLWKAi

i relapsed last week and i ended up increasing my tolerance so now i have to shove two suboxone films in my cheeks like a godamn junkie hamster
@catehall Pregabalin ftw, just throwing it out there. Sorted me right out.
@ThomasKlineMD fyi - I started adderall to make up for the loss of energy from 4 years of cancer treatment combined w/damaged pituitary, adrenal and thyroid glands. I couldn't stay awake for more than six hours, then a long nap (even w/daily steroids).  Much better now w/reduced pain a benefit.
@rronnilynn @kiraalex Yea.. Pills are horrible. I was on Xanax for a while but it would fuck up my memory so I've been smoking for 10 years..
@MissCocoDeluxe @rronnilynn Yeah Xanax is no joke. I'm glad you found something that works for you though. Anxiety is hell fr.
I need Adderall to get me through today.
My dad swear I be crashing my car cause I’m stoned, first off I was off Xanax
@BlakeMargot aight so i had a dream last night you had a ton of adderall in your pill bottle at the shore house and i was trying to take them while you were coming upstairs but you were coming to fast so i took the whole bottle😂😂😂😂 fucking weird dream man
Send a text to my ex, blame it on the xanax
Homies keep dyin fuck Xanax
why do xans feel like they last three days? @xanax
If you think you have the flu, please try to see a provider in the first 48 hours of symptoms onset; you can take Tamiflu during this time.Tamiflu, not to be confused with Theraflu, is an antiviral that shortens the amount of time you’re sick.
Say, I ain’t gon lie. I feel played that my people ain’t let me get adderall in highschool.
@WitchHuntTweets @vickieDiSabato Must be out of Xanax refills.
This happens far too often.
Tamiflu may also lessen your symptoms, but there’s no guarantees on that.If it turns out you don’t have the flu and you took Tamiflu, theresnot really a penalty for taking it; it’s not like antibiotics.Nausea is the most common side effect I’ve been told, but that is rare.
