@taketrumpdown I think Xanax is the only thing keeping me out of a strait-jacket. LOL

@DaddyDaddymac @Way2gosassy I am popping xanax like a pez dispenser..

@DamnitAddie My therapist didn't think I had BP II when I got diagnosed but I could definitely feel the cycles of deep depression to hypomania. Seroquel has helped a lot: it makes me sleep regularly so that helps me with routines.

which wasn‚Äôt surprising considering he was showing all the signs but instead of numbing reality with Xanax I left him and hooked up with the kid who beat the shit out of him but that was just a coincidence I promise !!!!

@rolandscahill I've got my case of Xanax on its way.

i havent taken adderall in so long i forgot how shitty it makes me feel bc all i wanna do is throw up rn dshjksdhdjksa

I might need prescribed adderall fr lol

@dominoblox I hope things are easier for you tomorrow. I was diagnosed with 4 different types of anxiety this past year and taken Xanax and Antivan before to manage accute panic. I take low doses and it just makes me feel sleepy and chill without negative side effects.

@_sloppymakeout I did oxy for 4 years then got off from suboxone. I got hooked on subs then had to taper to limit the wd of subs. Wasn‚Äôt as bad as oxy but was a few days longer w more psychological issues. Start your taper ASAP

"@MindfullyBiPola I was finally diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle of pain &amp; depression. I had 1 short depressive episode when I was 18 that was more situational &amp; it was before Prozac. They gave me something that made me feel awful

Why not do the test and top up the magnesium from the beginning?  Why neglect the depletion of magnesium while patient on Nexium or Esomeprazole until the patient lands up in hospital usually at the end of the road?  NHS is a Criminal Enterprise.

@maydaymindy9 Yes. Xanax is hard to get. Panic attacks at night are not good. Ptsd runs rampant.

@MindfullyBiPola Then another postpartum at 21 &amp; Prozac was like a miracle. But after a couple years it stopped working &amp; I went through the gamut of SSRIs. Then I got in a car accident at 29 that permanently injured my lower back &amp; I was always in pain &amp; needing pain meds.

Thank you for finally telling the truth! We know you didn‚Äôt have sex with lyrica! But he definitely made it seem like he did.  #LHHH

everybody got ‚Äúadhd‚Äù but no ones  letting me buy there adderall

Lyrica honestly cant think for one mf second that A1 DONT want a DNA BITCHHH THE WHOLE WORLD WANT A DNA üòÇüòÇüòÇ We Need To See Who This Baby Belong To #LHHH

This A1 and Lyrica storyline is so tired. If A1 has made peace with her cheating then why are we still talking about it? #LHHH

Lyrica‚Äôs hair keeps annoying me. It looks better black. She and A1 looks musty together ü§¢

I feel like Safari made a pass or sent Lyrica that pic or video #LHHH

When Safaree says that he never had sex with Lyrica when this been the storyline Mona been trotting out all season... #LHHH https://t.co/mbUYpb23Au

So you mean to tell me we waited all season just for Safaree to say he didnt sleep with Lyrica  #LHHH https://t.co/eiEUUGkojt

This Safaree and Lyrica situation is starting to give me a headache ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ. I don‚Äôt know who or what to believe anymore. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs lying and who‚Äôs telling the truth. #LHHH

"It appears that the only thing I'm capable of tonight is laying on my bed with my music so loud I can't think

#LHHH A1: did u sleep wit LyricaSafaree: (turned into this nigga) https://t.co/fxgOzxn7oI

She definitely smashed bc anyone would get tired of looking at A1's bleach blonde fucking locs during missionary every damn night.

Safaree might have sent a pic but he didnt sleep with Lyrica #LHHH

Ima 1000 percent sure lyrica fucked safaree #LHHHollywood

I don‚Äôt think Safaree &amp; Lyrica slept together but I do think he sent her a picture/video bc Lyrica G said Lyrica told her he sent her something inappropriate earlier #LHHH

I think it was like 12 or so episodes ago that I said Safaree was gonna come back and say that nothing happened with Lyrica... #LHHH https://t.co/fjAgEYoIgu

"I hate the way Safaree is handling this. He should be fully honest and stop giving vague answers. Part of me feels like he's being vague to protect someone's feelings (either A1 or Lyrica). Like something happened but he doesn't want to say ""She said it was cool."" #LHHH"

"the nerve of mona trying to sell us this fake lyrica/safaree scandal shit all season though. let me guess

#seasonfinale #lhhhollywood #LHHH I Honestly Feel Like #Lyrica Did Cheat On Him! And Her Lying Ass Need To Go On #Maury https://t.co/0Qsmn0TRcE

#Lhhh so it‚Äôs finally over @IAMSAFAREE is in the clear he didn‚Äôt smash  miss piggy üê∑ aka Lyrica but the jury is out if she finally gonna come clean to A1 about texting. Her previous ex boyfriends from her past. ü§î cause Lyrica seems real guilty  about the betrayal she did https://t.co/ZiAX8MceGt

A1 know he‚Äôs done dirt before too which is probably why he ain‚Äôt trippin on Lyrica but see they business is in the streets so it just looks bad  #LHHH

I hope a lot of the things that were said during this season comes out at the reunion.1) ‚Äúno one wants to hear your aunty music.‚Äù-brooke2) ‚ÄúI smashed lyrica.‚Äù-safaree3) ‚ÄúI rode lyrica.‚Äù-Roccstar#LHHH

A1 knows damn well Safaree and Lyrica did some inappropriate shit! Wether they fucked or not Lyrica did shit as a married women she was not suppose to do and Safaree participated and was a fucked up friend ! Case close   #LHHH

#Safaree: I never ever had sex with #Lyrica. Nothing happened. #LHHHEverybody: https://t.co/a6TV72v1Mr

Safaree says they texted about Lyrica saying A1 not giving her enough attention but when Lyrica showed A1 her message thread it was empty #LHHH https://t.co/ZElv3j1bV6

Lyrica telling A1 he left her by herself and she didn‚Äôt think he was coming back is basically her telling him she did talk to or fw other people for a minute lol. #LHHH #lhhhollywood
