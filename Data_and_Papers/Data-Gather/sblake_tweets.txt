Adderall had me like "my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy"â€ - said all the high schoolers during finals
Adderall had me thinking I was an ice road trucker on the way to work.pic.twitter.com/JblHk0F42T
@KNovak08 Did you start taking Tecfidera yet? If so, how are you feeling? My symptoms only lasted a few days. Doing great now.
The only think worse than adderall itself is the mornings when you can't remember if you've taken yet. Do you double up or go without? Ugh
UGH FUCK VYVANSE ITS 4:57 DAMMIT
@juuzz lol how far are you? Am just getting to heathway. I had bacon sandwich this morning. I need to get Imodium just in case Lool
Took 40 MG of adderall cause I had a math test, felt like fucking Stephen hawking reading that shit, turned out I got a 6% smh
@Tattooed_Priest no sir I'm not but I was hurting so bad earlier that I took an oxycodone right after I ate lunch & puked like 30 mins later
why does vyvanse make me pee so much
I've considered taking adderall wayyyy too many times this semester....
Forgetting to take my vyvanse is literally the worst thing ever..
my love/hate relationship with adderall is unreal
This adderall got like fucking yakking my head off oh my god I can't stop talking 
idk i took xanax and benadryl you feel me
One time I took Adderall and called everyone in my phone
This is what happens when you take adderall late in the day you can't fall asleep.
Forget everything else where tf is the adderall my mind needs???????
I got so wound up from these #Avalanche games that Xanax is my celebratory drug ... damn #cardiackids
I literally can't put anymore amphetamines in my system, but I did also just fall asleep with my eyes open. What the fuck
Tried to solve my first heart break with an 8 ball, Xanax & liquor... almost ended up having a fucking heart attack...
Can this xanax just kick in already. I don't wanna feel this shit in my chest anymore!
Driving on Vyvanse is hella weird
@KC_buzz Adderall helped me mentally quite a bit, but gave me skin issues. Just started Ritalin. I still have problems with conversations...
Is it possible that the pharmacist switched my vyvanse to cocaine because that would explain a lot.
synthroid completely kills my energy levels and armour thyroid makes my heart beat rapidly. think i'll just stay in bed all winter
Since I started metformin in May and I lost 21 pounds so far. Slow like a snail.
Can't wait to get my Vyvanse tomorrow. I feel obese.
So I have the flu and you literally can't get Tamiflu in Minny... They gave me ONE pill and told me to check back this week! #wtheck!!
When my adderall wheres off Alls I think about is food
ryanne took vyvanse and has the worst cotton mouth and won't stop chomping but has nothing in her mouth
In the 60s people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird people take prozac to make it normal. :-)
They're gonna put me back on xanax after this upcoming week. Sadly I actually need it but my dumb fuck generation makes me disgusted with it
Vyvanse had me doing homework in the LSU library when I'm enrolled in BRCC
tbt to when i first took xanax and fell asleep mid chocolate bar and woke up with it melted into my shirt
One time I did adderall and nothing happened then I realized i have adhd so it didn't do shit
Seriously I have smoked for 25 years and I never thought I would quit or even could really mild COPD motivated me cant let it get worse
I literally hate taking vyvanse lol although it may help me concentrate I hate the fact it makes you sweat. #sogay
I forgot to take my adderall cause I wasn't on my adderall
@BadoorSNK If armodafinil is available to you, I highly recommend it. I reacted poorly to it the first time I took 200mg, but never after.
adderall makes me move my eyebrows like crazy lol
I've got this awesome habit of not keeping adderall around. Therefore when I try to go to bed before 10 pm my mind says "no, 3am is better"
AIN FELT THIS SICK SINCE I CAME DOWN FROM FIVE WEEKS BEING HIGH ON OXYCODONE AFTER ANKLE SURGERY LAST YEAR
Bi-polar a$$ Kansas weather! Someone crush up a prozac and put it in the yard, maybe it'll evaporate and Mother nature will make up her mind
â€œ@AdderallHadMe: Adderall had me like "my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy"â€ 
Lost 9 pounds in 2 days thanks adderall no sleep and anxiety to tha max #dead
Adderall ain't letting me sleep
vyvanse got ya girl up all night 
took a fuckin adderall to stay awake and that shit literally made Christmas Eve kinda shitty
@Mory5ory @HurtBlogger yup. It's why we tried humira instead but it made me so sick. I'll deal cause it seems to work but it's no fun.
Waiting for my Adderall to wear off so I can fall asleep.. 
Needed lyrika to help take my hair out.. But we're not friends anymore
@MandaSayWat @PCOSGurl I switched to Armour Thyroid and upped Metformin dose. Along with 1100 calorie diet and yoga, I've dropped 44 lbs.
Got prescribed Adderall today and got so excited that I threw my car into a building.
fen faved my tweet my life is complete
I know the adderall kicked in bc I have the sudden urge to clean my room and finish all my homework
@trash_sleeper @diarrhea same for the other stuff just glad amphetamines make me feel too much like shit to get addicted to
Sleeping next to my vyvanse so I can take it the minute I open my eyes.
The only thing worse than watching this game is watching this game while simultaneously coming down from your vyvanse
I could use some adderall in my brain tea Ice up in my soy milk
@Star_Anise_LADA Was on oxycodone and pregabalin but both made me dumb & pregab gave me a seizure.
Dreading work today, but after watching hyper albuterol Bradley this morning, I'm ready plus half the class was out sick yesterday 
That one Tamiflu commercial where the man is larger than everything in his home makes me so uncomfortable
Im not even tired but thats prolly just the adderall ill crash in like two hours
No lie it's going to be tough going to sleep right now, some adderall would've been wavy right now.
@CassieGannis Stay in bed 'til you feel better. Fluids and analgesic. Doctor's for Tamiflu if it's just starting.
@MGscoli Sprintec is Birth control ;) and temazapam helps me sleep (insomnia from pain)
@sanchosway: Weed & Adderall numbs my pain. Yo mova numbs my pain
Adderall is working great for me I just watched 3 days worth of my Vine feed for 2 hours
legit feel bad for anyone I talk to when I'm on vyvanse cause they're in for an ear-full of nonsense
Tamiflu Cuts 1 Day Off Average Flu Bout, Study Finds
@ShaggyCoe oh no! You are getting the flu! I can't believe how the tamiflu has made me feel so much better. Call your Dr please. xxx
so proud of jess <3 she just told me "god I miss eating" as she ate another vyvanse and poorly attempted to study
My next patient was suffering from breathing problems. COPD and a probable chest infection. Given nebs and crew transported to ED
honestly maybe i shouldn't have stopped taking fluoxetine but then again they gave me a fake happy it was so bad tbh
Xanax withdrawal is probably the worst thing I've been through. mfs don't even know. don't overdo it.
don't know why I thought adderall would be a good idea since I already feel like shit but hey
@davidcoates47 Do you mean wank? How would you wank? He's blind not a Thalidomide birth defect victim!
It's fascinating just laying here & feeling the oxycodone slowly take effect #weeee
@Salahovich_ @HalaLoCa ventolin inhaler never taken every 3 hours, it taken on demand only your regimen will cause palpitation and tremors
Dont drink hot chocolate then take your albuterol inhaler. It's worse than brushing your teeth and orange juice. 
Adderall makes me talk so much damn
@collegefession: Snorted Adderall to help me study but instead ended up brushing my teeth for 30 minutes" - OSU" Lmfaooooo
So let me get this straight. The BLOOD THINNER Xarelto causes bleeding. Well duh. So Let's sue. Then complain about the high cost of meds
I took an Oxycodone pill and a Lorazepam an hour ago why is it not kicking in my mouth is throbbing and I want to sleep
@KittyCormack @no_ghost @EmbodiedTales @MonsterYarn same. Quetiapine withdrawals bad too. Sickness, hungover feeling, restlessness, insomnia
Mu protein diet with my ventolin doest really go that well. Hello shaky hands 
I Swear Mfrs Always Got Shit 4 Sale But When I Want Adderall Every Body Dry Af
adderall had my stomach hurting
@RockLeeSmile Trazadone knocks me out pretty quickly, but then again I'm on 200mg of it. Never have taken an OTC sleep med before.
So, temazepam isn't enough to convince my body it wants to sleep past 1:30am. Anyone got anything? I can't take this much longer. 
@dawn_hutton Oxycodone also numbs the pain when watford lose , been munching far too many last few weeks :(
I need some fucking adderall so I won't get so distracted when doing shit so I could sleep on time.
There's shitty days, and then there's days when you drop your Prozac behind the refrigerator.
This Adderall has me feeling like in rolling
I swear the world stops spinning when I'm constipated... Does anyone else experience this phenomenon? *sips Miralax on ice*
Adderall got me tripping otc
@JasonRPeters417 @LEAFcouncil Suboxone eliminated his cravings and withdrawal symptoms and it precludes getting high.
@mi2guys @osaxy @tstallone I was out on it to get me off Paxil so I could wean off it instead of Paxil. The equivalent swap didn't work it
I'm starting to see why Neurontin gets called "Morontin". It has turned me into a hibernating bear! But one with slightly less sore paws.
Should not have took that adderall earlier. I can't sleep what so ever right now
@DJAntGQ wow that's literally my life lol, I take nexium everyday and try my best not to eat anything you mentioned but it's close to imposs
I haven't ate a full meal in 2 days , adderall got me all fucked up
Feeling MUCH better today... Man that TamiFlu is LEGIT! Well worth the $50 in my book. Maybe Christmas can be saved??
vyvanse has me going to my 8 am without having slept HAHAhhahahahahagagaagga
this commercial for COPD medicine has all blow up doll everything & it is freaking me out that someone was paid to have this idea.
It's almost shark week and I skipped pristiq yesterday by accident. bring me puppies, chocolate, ice cream and tissues.
I took adderall ONE time and that shit had me washing my car at two in the morning. Never again.
Just remembered my mom wanted me to apply to a school that I didn't want to go to so I wrote my essay about how Adderall got me thru ju-co 
@JNJCares I can't travel. Still getting used to my wheelchair. Your Levaquin antibiotic mutilated my nerves, crippled me for life.
Ambulance call ahead to get resus bed ready for patient with chest problems making their COPD worse and breathing very difficult
I hate this dumb tamiflu pill. It makes me nauseous 
You KNOW you're tired when adderall can't even wake you up
@wood_brwood333 Aye, my pain meds were prescribed by a pain specialist, so Oxycodone & Lyrica as longterm - AM & PM & Dilaudid every 4 hours
â€œ@wrxdamon: adderall got me working out math problems in my headâ€ FOR NO DAMN REASON FAM OMG
@santokuscales ohhh neat you're taking seroquel too! I'm taking it with Citalopram and occasionally zopiclone when I'm too anxious to sleep
4 days on Effexor and the depression is finally coming under control. Klonopin easing off the constant anxiety. I can almost breathe again.
*McKennah about to get her hair colored* McKennah: Are you nervous? Me: No. McKennah: Why? Me: I took a Xanax before we left... 
I'm feeling much better these days. I guess the Paxil has fully taken effect. Thanks to my friends on Twitter for listening & sharing.
Could this be you? I take Metformin for the diabetes caused by the Hydrochlorothiazide I take for high blood pressure which I got from...
thank fucking god my vyvanse prescription is getting written next week
This victoza medication im on makes me soooo nauseous
Adderall got me making my bed in MLA format
MY boss told me that being emotionally unstable because I ran out of prozac is not an excuse to miss work WHILE I WAS CRYING IN HER OFFICE
Medicine companies be like take Latuda for your minor headache, Side effects may include diarrhea, stomach pain, and maybe even death.
Watching labyrinth and eatin some shit from Jason's Deli about to cry bc I'm not on Vyvanse and everyone is being dookie life is so weird
GABAPENTIN MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YELLING
Maybe taking that adderall late was a bad idea. #Insomnia
I remember when @JeffreeStar told me to pop a Xanax when I was upset about his EP being delayed. 
Taking a shower on xanax mad wavy
â€œ@AdderallHadMe: Adderall had me calculating the lowest grades I can get on my finals instead of studyingâ€ SO me its not even funny
Just had my gabapentin,tramadol and fluoxitine breakfast #fibromyalgia sucks
The others are waking up now... I don't think mum will like that I didn't sleep at all, since I didn't want to take the seroquel last night
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day for my back pain," Adderall to stay focused, Xanax to take the edge off, pot to mellow me out...
@Jonesss3 maybe if I just don't go to sleep it won't be as bad, and then I'll just double up on my adderall in the morning
Pretty sure my mom threw away my last tamiflu pill. I'm gonna get the flu again.
I think the albuterol makes me shake. Yikes.
T5 Tamiflu needs to be given within 2 days of first flu symptoms to be most effective. Early detection is important. #abcdrbchat
The Starbucks and vyvanse combo is the best way to cure a hangover
Literally was up since 4. Fuck you adderall
Vyvanse are my only hope for getting anything done in life
@WelshGasDoc At least it isn't swine flu. Swine flu is doubleplus bad. So bad that oseltamivir might actually be indicated.

God made us brothers, but Prozac made us friends.
Adderall got me excited to do my homework that's due next week
I hate taking vyvanse because, just like every other time, my heart is beating out of my fucking chest... I AM TOO DAMN HYPER TO SCHOOL...

@LeetMay adderall does that to you. I eat too much it's ridiculous
@rbnphoto and his @muddysbakeshop Prozac cake saved my mood today. Nothing says stress cure like drowning in chocolate!
Heyyy remember when vyvanse was adequate motivation?
seroquel was supposed to make me feel better but I guess it was just placebo like usual. BETTER BE EVEN MORE CYNICAL NEXT TIME
Seriously considering taking a seroquel just so i can go to sleep omg

Must've looked exhausted in lab bc a random offered me adderall 
I feel dat Trazadone kicking in 
my doctor is "nervous" because my weight i went from 100 to 97.4 tryna cut me off my adderall & shiiiiet.
I think the Effexor buzz has finally worn off enough for me to sleep.
Today is the first day I've taken a vyvanse since Saturday #up #wired #getshitdone #letsdothis
REALLY makes ya think RT @EricLuallen: Wait, the most common side effect of Tamiflu is nausea and vomiting? Uh...

This americano has me feeling like I sniffed some adderall damn 
I don't feel like studying...I'm going to fail this exam. I think I need to take an adderall
my baby just exhausted all that damn albuterol wore him out
Just cause I take xanax to calm down doesn't mean I take it cause I'll set your shit on fire.
Took my adderall too late today and now I can't sleep. Typ
My mom flushed my adderall but is now taking me to get it prescribed... What sense does any of that make
At that point where Adderall deff just put me to sleep #qc #qcfinalsweek #notevendrugswork #overit
S/O To @alexischadron for thinking my adderall was Advil pretty much just died
