@DamnitAddie My therapist didn't think I had BP II when I got diagnosed but I could definitely feel the cycles of deep depression to hypomania. Seroquel has helped a lot: it makes me sleep regularly so that helps me with routines.
i havent taken adderall in so long i forgot how shitty it makes me feel bc all i wanna do is throw up rn dshjksdhdjksa
wish I had my sleeping meds  trazodone ðŸ˜“ another sleepless night and over it. My mom doesnâ€™t care but as usual
@oooze_ I take Seroquel due to night terrors/sleepwalking and it works great. My issue is getting back up the next day.
So the #seizures started back up Halloween night. Been having to sleep with my mom. I call these seizures "waves of death" because it feels like I die for a second. Great fun. I needed new trauma lol #Paxil #withdrawals #meds #antidepressants #ssri #Psychiatry

Holy fuck. I laid down for nap &amp; my brain launched a FULL SCALE PANIC ATTACK: sobbing, feelings of doom, hyperventilation, akathisia, etc.Took xanax. Incoherently called my aunt &amp; she talked me down some.Now doing work b/c my traitorous brain wonâ€™t let me fucking sleep.ðŸ˜‘ https://t.co/ehidupmaSJ
adderall makes me so upset like why do you have to make me involuntarily clench my jaw??? I hate????????
If you ever feel like you aren't good enough, just remember half a xanax made drake fall asleep for 15 hours. Then he tried to flex about it ðŸ˜‚
@dominoblox I hope things are easier for you tomorrow. I was diagnosed with 4 different types of anxiety this past year and taken Xanax and Antivan before to manage accute panic. I take low doses and it just makes me feel sleepy and chill without negative side effects.
@MindfullyBiPola I was finally diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Itâ€™s awful. Itâ€™s a vicious cycle of pain &amp; depression. I had 1 short depressive episode when I was 18 that was more situational &amp; it was before Prozac. They gave me something that made me feel awful, I stopped it &amp; got better.
@MindfullyBiPola Then another postpartum at 21 &amp; Prozac was like a miracle. But after a couple years it stopped working &amp; I went through the gamut of SSRIs. Then I got in a car accident at 29 that permanently injured my lower back &amp; I was always in pain &amp; needing pain meds.
them: so how did you lose all that weight??me: get your heartbroken &amp; take vyvanse
took xanax out my diet cause it used to make my mood switch. live or die it ainâ€™t up to you God gone choose it
me trying to fix my sleep schedule vs me taking an adderall at 10pm
@medicalaxioms Levofloxacin, Metoprolol, Diclofenac, Lorazepam, Prednisone.
I took my adderall when I woke up rather than at 6 when I would normally take it and i was not cranky but I was so focused on finding collectibles in god of war that I spent all my time doing that. I have one more to take for today but I want to save it for tonight to stay awake.
TOOK XANAX OUT MY DIET CUS IT WOULD MAKE MY MOOD SWITCH
@TheNewYorkDoll Ohhh lamictal made me break out in huge welps within 3 weeks. Itâ€™s called Steven Johnsonâ€™s syndrome- be careful !!
@indik I'm so sorry. Never tried cymbalta myself but had bad zaps and mild vertigo the last time I stopped Zyloft/sertraline. That was 5 years ago and I'm so hesitant to try anything again, tbh.
@SGottliebFDA @FDA_Drug_Info Bull shit. Compare the price of vicodin, percocet, etc to cost of therapy, detox, suboxone, alternative pain management meds, physical therapy, etc. You dont care about people addicted to pain meds.
@YellowDogBill First psychiatrist visit is tomorrow morning. Here's hoping I don't have to get prescribed Seroquel or trazodone. That crap made me feel so sick
This Xanax has made me really freaking sleepy
@crow_death Good luck out there! Iâ€™m not on lithium but Iâ€™m on lamotrigine for my schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type) and can usually go a couple days without noticing a difference ðŸ¤ž
No way Tylerâ€™s sister Amber is addicted to adderall. Nobody who takes adderall would let their house be that disgusting. ðŸ˜³ #TeenMomOG
