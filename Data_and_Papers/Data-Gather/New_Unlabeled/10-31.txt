1054118308226781185	526575903	On the other hand, My cousin Nick was on Ritalin from the age of 4 to 23. Even 5 years after he stopped He's never held a job over 6 months, has 5 kids, and says he's Homo Occulta, the newest evolution of mankind. All while living on welfare.

1054600145692700672	27515171	@senditsarah I was prescribed Adderall for adult ADHD, and took it for several months, but ultimately decided it really didn't do what I'd hoped it would. I do understand why many people do take it, and think it's perfectly safe to use. I quit taking it with zero problems.

The others 4-5 hours before bedtime. I have a delayed sleep issue as well. I've reduced sleep meds considerably through the years. Thanks for taking the time.

1055825389002674176	989940502748377088	About 1/4 of the total efficacy/safety events occurred in the 75+ year old population. Xarelto plus aspirin wasn't better than aspirin alone for the efficacy outcome in this subgroup analysis and was associated with more bleeds (exploratory still)
1055825388109217792	989940502748377088	However, it seems like this would be a great population to risk-stratify with the new FDA approval of Xarelto post-ACS. A look through a few of the subgroup analyses in COMPASS (explicitly mentioned as exploratory, by the way) shows a few first steps here.
1055825389891792897	989940502748377088	Another possible group to avoid could be those without underlying hyperlipidemia. Though there were not many events in this group (just under 10%), addition of Xarelto was not associated with improved efficacy and was associated with increased risk of bleeds.

1056291712266465280	2468699718	@pdbuchan as a rough ordering:OTC stimulants (caffeine, ephedrine, etc) boost NR (norepinephrine) more than DA (dopamine).methlyphenidate is a bit NR-biased (i know a LOT of people who cannot handle ritalin for this reason)amphetamine is a bit DA-biased, but not much

1056292038243545088	2468699718	@pdbuchan there are no real dopamine-selective stimulants on the market. modafinil is a Weird Not-Really-Stimulant, and it's not as "powerful" as adderall, but some people find it significantly more tolerable.

1057222089265106944	369629573	I thought Klonopin was an SSRI for some reason. I didn't realize it was in the same family as Xanax and Valium. It's crazy how addicting these drugs are, and how freely doctors prescribe them. Honestly, SSRI's take longer to become effective, but highly recommend.

1057254738801123328	193508679	Ran out of adderall because I'm trying to ask my psych why he switched to a brand that cost 3x as much. But he basically only works one day per month. I thought my feeling awake was due to my anti anxiety meds providing me with me sleep. But apparently it was not. So exhausted.

Have you tried that? I still have pain but less. I have done that twice now. Seems to last about a year to 18 months.
