1054118308226781185	526575903	On the other hand, My cousin Nick was on Ritalin from the age of 4 to 23. Even 5 years after he stopped He's never held a job over 6 months, has 5 kids, and says he's Homo Occulta, the newest evolution of mankind. All while living on welfare.

1054600145692700672	27515171	@senditsarah I was prescribed Adderall for adult ADHD, and took it for several months, but ultimately decided it really didn't do what I'd hoped it would. I do understand why many people do take it, and think it's perfectly safe to use. I quit taking it with zero problems.

The others 4-5 hours before bedtime. I have a delayed sleep issue as well. I've reduced sleep meds considerably through the years. Thanks for taking the time.

1055825389002674176	989940502748377088	About 1/4 of the total efficacy/safety events occurred in the 75+ year old population. Xarelto plus aspirin wasn't better than aspirin alone for the efficacy outcome in this subgroup analysis and was associated with more bleeds (exploratory still)
1055825388109217792	989940502748377088	However, it seems like this would be a great population to risk-stratify with the new FDA approval of Xarelto post-ACS. A look through a few of the subgroup analyses in COMPASS (explicitly mentioned as exploratory, by the way) shows a few first steps here.
1055825389891792897	989940502748377088	Another possible group to avoid could be those without underlying hyperlipidemia. Though there were not many events in this group (just under 10%), addition of Xarelto was not associated with improved efficacy and was associated with increased risk of bleeds.
