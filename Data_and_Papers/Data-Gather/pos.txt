@KNovak08 Did you start taking Tecfidera yet? If so, how are you feeling? My symptoms only lasted a few days. Doing great now.

@Tattooed_Priest no sir I'm not but I was hurting so bad earlier that I took an oxycodone right after I ate lunch & puked like 30 mins later

Took xanax today for the first time today in a few weeks... OMG. Why did my dumbass stop taking them?
@shriekhouse that is how I react too. I switched to Xopenex and it's not nearly as bad.
Tried to solve my first heart break with an 8 ball, Xanax & liquor... almost ended up having a fucking heart attack...
Can this xanax just kick in already. I don't wanna feel this shit in my chest anymore!
Driving on Vyvanse is hella weird
@KC_buzz Adderall helped me mentally quite a bit, but gave me skin issues. Just started Ritalin. I still have problems with conversations...
Is it possible that the pharmacist switched my vyvanse to cocaine because that would explain a lot.
my adderall finally kicked in and now my entire room is organized so typical
synthroid completely kills my energy levels and armour thyroid makes my heart beat rapidly. think i'll just stay in bed all winter
Since I started metformin in May and I lost 21 pounds so far. Slow like a snail.
Can't wait to get my Vyvanse tomorrow. I feel obese.

When my adderall wheres off Alls I think about is food
@TheMusic01234 I'm gonna have my ventolin & tissue w/in reach bc I KNOW the #SavingHope finale is gonna have me an emotional mess!

In the 60s people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird people take prozac to make it normal. :-)
They're gonna put me back on xanax after this upcoming week. Sadly I actually need it but my dumb fuck generation makes me disgusted with it

@KevinWalsh222 heard it was the Oxycodone that caused it, still karma.
I literally hate taking vyvanse lol although it may help me concentrate I hate the fact it makes you sweat. #sogay
Note to self: Take an Imodium in the morning. The last thing you need is to get the shits on a plane.
I forgot to take my adderall cause I wasn't on my adderall
@BadoorSNK If armodafinil is available to you, I highly recommend it. I reacted poorly to it the first time I took 200mg, but never after.

It's not just make believe When they make me take a seat And put amphetamines in the air and make me breathe.
4 days on Effexor and the depression is finally coming under control. Klonopin easing off the constant anxiety. I can almost breathe again.
if you rilly think I'd take things like Adderall if it didn't drastically improve / help, you my friend are wrong as wrong can get
after this crazy lady tells me about her xanax being "stolen" while passed out for two days, she says "oh, youre pregnant! i'll babysit!" no

Niggas drove a hour and spent 60 bucks to get Vyvanse and was sold some shit that cure gonorrhea and syphilis. 
thank fucking god my vyvanse prescription is getting written next week
If you drink alcohol on Metformin you will die!! FALSE. FALSE. FALSE. Don't binge drink and enjoy your life. RELAX.

I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day for my back pain," Adderall to stay focused, Xanax to take the edge off, pot to mellow me out...
@Jonesss3 maybe if I just don't go to sleep it won't be as bad, and then I'll just double up on my adderall in the morning
