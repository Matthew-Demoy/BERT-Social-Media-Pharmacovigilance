Addiction Medicine a new Medical Specialty 2015 and unlike eBay this industry has NO rules or regulations. Marketing is killing and manmade opioids like Suboxone are being sold on multi-levels.

1053092181492154369	423850297	I’ve been taking Effexor (venlafaxine) since March 1st and it has basically ruined my life. I know everyone has different experiences with medication but the withdrawals and side effects are AWFUL for me, and I’ve read that others have this experience with it as well.
1053092188916051968	423850297	Anyway, I just thought this was useful info. I don’t think antidepressants are bad necessarily, this one just didn’t work for me and I thought I’d share my experience for anyone that’s been looking into taking Effexor.

1053807001724022784	1029786831783489536	@godesosa I have BPD, not bipolar, but I've been on Seroquel since May and taken 50mg since August. I also took Resperdal when I was a teenager. I've noticed that it's lessened my negatives, but I haven't seen a lot of positives. Seroquel's made me gain 50lbs in six months.

There's a generic form of Buprenorphine that u can get for less than 3 dollars each. U have no insurance? Ask for it? NOPE! Why? No kickbacks. Few clinics are ethically sound.
1053838644631482368	1607218952	In the US, pregabalin is dispensed under the brand name Lyrica. It is a precursor to gabapentin. In the US pregabalin is already a controlled substance. Why isn't gabapentin?! https://t.co/wUyUQX5RtV

Lyrica works very well taken together with Buprenorphine (Temgesic).

I fully blame Big Pharma.Judging by the street price, it’s just too cheap for them to run a profit so they seem to prefer pushing Xanax and Diazepam instead.But as long as it’s an RC it’s legal w/o prescription. Perfect for when your GP tells you anxiety isn’t real.

I’ve heard it has been seriously traumatic for many kids and that some are still finding citrate free painful. 😕 infusions were the right choice for our family

1054045387105820672	522785480	If you think you have the flu, please try to see a provider in the first 48 hours of symptoms onset; you can take Tamiflu during this time.Tamiflu, not to be confused with Theraflu, is an antiviral that shortens the amount of time you’re sick.

1054046238121676800	522785480	Tamiflu may also lessen your symptoms, but there’s no guarantees on that.If it turns out you don’t have the flu and you took Tamiflu, theresnot really a penalty for taking it; it’s not like antibiotics.Nausea is the most common side effect I’ve been told, but that is rare.
